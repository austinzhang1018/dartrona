March 5, 2020, Update
To the Dartmouth community,
This morning a Tuck School of Business student contacted the school administration to say that they were experiencing flu-like symptoms. This student had attended the event for Tuck and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) guests on Feb. 28 at the Engine Room in White River Junction, Vermont. A DHMC employee who attended that party has tested positively for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, Tuck decided to cancel the last remaining day of classes for the term. The student who is feeling unwell is self-isolating and is waiting to learn if they should be tested for COVID-19. Tuck will hold exams for core classes online. They are planning to hold spring classes as usual.
