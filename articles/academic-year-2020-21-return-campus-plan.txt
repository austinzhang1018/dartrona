Academic Year 2020-21 Return to Campus Plan
On June 29, 2020, Dartmouth released its plan to bring students back to campus for the coming 2020-21 academic year. See a link at left to the email sent to the Dartmouth community from President Hanlon and Provost Helble. Also available at left is a set of frequently asked questions explaining details related to the next academic year. The plan emphasizes the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff and includes testing for the COVID-19 virus, remote learning for many on-campus students, and plans to evaluate and modify operations each term if virus conditions change. Approximately half of the undergraduate student body will return to campus for each term. The graduate and professional schools have set related plans for their operation.
