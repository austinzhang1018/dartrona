March 7, 2020, Update
As many of us prepare to leave campus following the end of term, we'd like to remind everyone of our international and domestic travel guidelines.
Dartmouth continues to discourage all international travel for students, faculty, and staff, including conference attendance and research site visitation.
Those who choose to travel internationally and return from or transit through a country that is rated as a CDC Level 2 or 3 will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, and those returning from a CDC Level 1 country will be required to self-observe for 14 days. To be clear, self-quarantine for travel that commenced after March 4, 2020 will need to occur off campus. Self-observation can occur on campus. Guidance on conducting self-quarantine and self-observation can be found in the "important updates" section.
The College currently has no restrictions on domestic travel but continues to monitor this situation daily as guidance from state and federal authorities is updated and travel disruptions evolve.
There are no confirmed cases of people with COVID-19 on campus at this time. Finals period for undergraduates this week, and on-campus spring classes for all students will be held as planned. This is a fluid situation and we will continue to update you regarding any changes to our operations or policies.
On a final note, we have made posters, fact sheets, and digital signage slides available in the "communications resources" section of the Dartmouth COVID-19 website. We encourage faculty, staff, and student leaders to access these materials and post them in appropriate areas.
Thank you for helping us continue to safeguard the health and well-being of our community.
Sincerely,
Dr. Lisa Adams
