March 3, 2020, Update
To the Dartmouth community,
We write to follow up on Monday's announcement regarding the diagnosis of a Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) employee with COVID-19. We recently learned that this individual attended a Tuck School of Business social event in White River Junction on Friday, February 28. An investigation of those who were in close contact with that individual is underway and all close contacts have been notified; at this time, there are no Dartmouth students considered to be close contacts.
If you have symptoms associated with COVID-19, such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, please seek medical care. Dartmouth students should contact Dick's House at 603-646-9400 and faculty and staff should contact their primary care provider.
We understand that this is a stressful time for many people in our community. We remain in close communication with state health officials and DHMC and are coordinating efforts with colleagues across the institution to ensure everyone's continued health and safety.
For more information on COVID-19, please consult the following resources:
