{"title": "Community Conversations: Support for International Students", "text": "Watch the July 8 Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and COVID-19 task force co-chair Josh Keniston, vice president for institutional projects, and Elizabeth Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\nDartmouth has pledged support for international students in the face of guidance issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) prohibiting international students from remaining in the U.S. if their classes will be entirely online, Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday during Community Conversations, a series of live webcasts about Dartmouth's operations during the pandemic.\nIn a statement issued today, Dartmouth said it had joined peer institutions in opposing the guidelines and was \"actively engaged in identifying possible solutions for fall term instruction and housing, as informed by the potential impact of the SEVP guidance.\"\nHelble and his guests, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Elizabeth Smith and Vice President for Institutional Projects Josh Keniston, discussed Dartmouth's plan to bring students back to campus this fall, as announced on June 29. During the hour-long conversation, moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, the three fielded viewer questions regarding details about the coming academic year, only some of which could be answered at this point. Others will be answered in mid-August, as Dartmouth continues to monitor the progression of COVID-19.\nTo viewers' requests for a description of what campus life might look like when students return this fall, Helble said it most certainly will be different.\n\"It will be different on this campus. It will be different on every campus, and I think there's no way of avoiding that as we watch the progression of the disease, particularly over the past few months.\"\nThose differences will include the enforcement of social-distancing standards and the requirement that students wear masks when they are in common spaces, said Helble, speaking from Starr Studio in Dartmouth Library's Baker-Berry Library.\nHe reiterated Dartmouth's commitment to protecting the health of students, faculty, and staff, and the Upper Valley community.\n\"We recognize the importance of providing opportunities and outlets for our students, but it is public health and public health guidance that is going to be the primary determining factor in what we are able to do,\" Helble said.\nOther viewers had questions about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for students returning to campus, which Keniston, co-chair of Dartmouth's COVID-19 task force, said is a vital component of bringing students back to campus.\n\"The Upper Valley has had very low incidence of community transmission, and so welcoming thousands of students from across the country will be one of the critical areas where we need to make sure we're protecting our community and that we are identifying any potential cases that may have come from elsewhere,\" and isolating and taking care of them, said Keniston, speaking from his campus office.\nThe task force is spending a lot of time thinking about students' physical and mental health needs while in quarantine, he said, and while it's still unclear exactly what that 14-day period will entail, students should expect \"to spend a fair amount of time in their rooms.\"\nHelble thanked the Dartmouth students for their attention and engagement during the pandemic, and asked for their involvement as the institution continues to work through operational issues that affect them.\n\"We need your input and your partnership in working through many of these questions for fall term,\" he said. Kathryn Lively, dean of the College, has been meeting with student leaders throughout the past six weeks and will create an advisory group by the end of this week to solicit input from students in areas \"where we have choices.\"\nJon Kull '88, dean of the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, has been meeting regularly with the graduate student council and will continue to meet with the members to address their questions. He will also seek graduate student input on issues relevant to the broader graduate student community, said Helble, adding that the respective deans will continue to answer questions for the Tuck School of Business, Thayer School of Engineering, Geisel School of Medicine, and other communities about program-specific issues.\nBefore registering for classes, students will know how the courses will be taught\u2014entirely online, in person, or in a hybrid format, where they may have a class with students who are on-campus and others who are off campus, Smith said. As fall term approaches, faculty members, some of whom will be teaching remotely for the first time, will have support from many areas\u2014the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, the Information, Technology and Consulting division, instructional designers, and from their departments.\nWith experience from two terms of remote teaching, including a number of lab courses, faculty will determine how to offer their classes this fall. That latitude is based on safety and pedagogy, Smith said.\nAs dean, her charge includes responsibility for matters related to faculty development, functioning, and well-being, she said. \"I take that well-being very seriously.\"\nFaculty members know best whether they should teach remotely or in person, and which mode best suits their course material, Smith said. When they are comfortable and feel safe, and are not anxious about teaching in front of a classroom, and they can design their courses in the way they feel is best, \"you are going to have the best outcome.\"\nHelble and his guests also addressed these topics:\nEfforts to pack and return students' belongings were bolstered with the addition of 50 staff members to the project. Graduating seniors' belongings have been packed, and shipping will be completed by the end of this month. The remaining students' belongings will be packed and shipped by mid-August. Some students have arranged to pick up their belongings. As of last week, 60 percent of the undergraduate student rooms had been packed.\nThe stacks in Baker-Berry Library and the Sherman Art Library have opened to Dartmouth students, faculty and staff, and Rauner Special Collections Library is open by appointment to faculty, staff, and graduate students.\nOn-campus research labs continue to open, with greater access being granted in stages.\nAccess to telehealth services, including mental health resources, will likely continue in the fall.\nStudents and faculty will likely have limited access to Hood Museum of Art materials, but the performing arts venues are among the most challenging operations to reopen. Gym facilities fall somewhere in between.\nStudents living on campus will receive priority for access to on-campus services and facilities. The institution cannot guarantee the same access to students living off campus.\nIt is unlikely that off-campus international programs will be offered during the winter term; a decision will be announced before students need to register for fall classes. A decision will also be forthcoming on spring term 2021 off-campus programs.\nCommunity Conversations is an online forum for Dartmouth community members to ask questions and learn from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the pandemic. The live discussions, produced by Dartmouth's Media Production Group and the Office of Communications, air on selected Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. The next webcast is set for July 22. Past episodes are available on the Community Conversations site, which also includes call-in numbers for those who want to listen to the show without video.

{"title": "New Health Screening Guidelines", "text": "Frequently Asked Questions About COVID-19 Health Screening\nWhat is the new health screening requirement, and when does it go into effect?\nThe New Hampshire Governor's Economic Reopening Taskforce has distributed universal guidelines for New Hampshire employers to put in place to provide a healthy work environment. Effective May 11, the guidelines state, \"Employers must develop a process for screening all employees reporting for work for COVID-19 related symptoms.\" Employers must also require all employees who are sick or not feeling well to stay home.\nWho must follow the screening requirement guidelines?\nAll Dartmouth paid employees are required to follow the guidelines every day that they come to campus, beginning May 11, 2020.\nDartmouth is also requiring that any student (undergraduate, graduate, or professional student) or postdoc who enters academic or administrative campus buildings for authorized activities must comply with the requirements of this process.\nWhat do the health screening requirements require employees, students, and postdocs to do?\nOn each day they come to campus, Dartmouth employees, students, and postdocs subject to this process are required to take their temperature and record it on a website called the Temperature Self-Assessment, or TSA, and answer five questions related to COVID-19 exposure and symptoms. They must also follow the guidelines at the end of the survey regarding whether they should report to work or for authorized activities.\nWhat are the questions that must be answered each day as part of the Temperature Self-Assessment (TSA) screening?\nThe questions, as set out in the state guidelines, are:\nHave you been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the past 14 days? Have you had a fever or felt feverish in the last 72 hours? Are you experiencing any new respiratory symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, or shortness of breath? Are you experiencing any new muscle aches or chills? Have you experienced any new change in your sense of taste or smell?\nIf an employee responds \"yes\" to any of the questions, they must refrain from going to campus or, if they are on campus already, they must leave campus immediately and contact their physician. They must also notify their supervisor that they will not be at work.\nIf a student or postdoc subject to this process responds \"yes\" to any of the questions, they must refrain from going to campus or, if they have already traveled to campus, they must leave campus immediately. Students should contact Dick's House and postdocs should contact their primary care provider for further assessment and guidance. They must also notify their advisor or dean that they will not be at their research or activity location that day.\nHow can I obtain medical clearance that allows me to work on site?\nIf the health screening tool indicated that you should not report to work, but you do not believe your symptoms are due to COVID-19, contact your health care provider or Dick's House to discuss. Until and unless your medical provider confirms that it is unlikely that you have COVID-19 and that your symptoms have another more likely explanation (i.e. allergies, muscle strain, etc.), you should not report to work and should follow the guidelines regarding sick employees. After consulting with your medical provider, documentation should be provided to Dick's House. The clinical staff there will assess the situation and provide you with the medical clearance to be given to your supervisor or principal investigator.\nWho can see the information that people are submitting through the five-question screening? With whom will it be shared?\nInformation submitted through the screening questions will be treated as confidential information accessible only by individuals in Human Resources. Supervisors and deans/advisors will be given information only on whether the screening was completed and whether the results determined that the employee, student, or postdoc subject to this process should or should not be at work or at their research (or other approved) location on campus. Supervisors and deans/advisors will not see the answers to the individual questions, or the temperature reported.\nWhat's the best process for employees, students, and postdocs subject to this process to conduct their health screening?\nBefore coming to work each day, or reporting for approved academic activities, employees, students, and postdocs subject to this process with internet access or a smartphone should log onto the Dartmouth health screening website and respond to the questions asked. The website is: dartgo.org/tsa. Based on the responses, the website will indicate whether it is fine to report to work or a research (or other educational) location.\nIf I'm only going to my office to pick up mail or get supplies and will only be there for a short time, do I have to comply with this requirement?\nYes. Anyone accessing a Dartmouth building is expected to comply.\nWhat about employees, students, or postdocs subject to this process who don't have internet access or a smartphone to conduct their health screening prior to coming to work?\nEmployees, students, and postdocs subject to this process who are unable or forget to conduct their health screening at home, should have their health screening conducted on campus as soon as they arrive. Several locations have been established to conduct the screenings. At each location, someone will be available to take your temperature using a non-contact thermometer. They will also record your responses to the series of health-related questions on the Dartmouth TSA website using a tablet computer. Only the individual who is conducting the health screening will touch the computer.\nWhat are the locations and hours for the on-campus health screenings? UPDATED July 8, 2020\nScreenings are available at the following locations:\nClass of 1953 Commons, north dining room; 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., daily\nHopkins Center, 5:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekdays; enter through Hinman Mail Services\nDick's House, foyer; 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., weekdays; enter through Rope Ferry/Dewey Field parking lot\nNew location available beginning July 13: Vail building, foyer by the loading dock; 5:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekdays; (Life Sciences Center location will no longer be available)\nDick's House is available for assistance checking temperatures but cannot assist in answering the online questionnaire. Students and postdocs subject to this process and employees who have access to the internet or a smartphone can use the Dick's House location. Locations will be set up to keep those waiting in line 6-feet apart.\nAre the students living on campus required to be screened?\nNo. Students living on campus who are not engaged in approved activities requiring that they be present in academic or administrative campus buildings are not required to be screened. However, any student employee who is actively working on campus must participate in a daily health screening just as all other Dartmouth employees.\nDo I need to wear a mask to the screening or when I'm on campus?\nThese measures include wearing a face mask or covering in locations where you are not able to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others. Face masks can slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\nAre these processes final?\nThe processes described above are part of a pilot program that was developed to comply immediately with the state's new requirements. Based on the results of this pilot, the processes will be reviewed and may be revised to improve the experience for users and to meet evolving federal and state guidance.\nWhom do I contact if I have questions about this health screening process?\nQuestions may be directed to the Human Resources Office at human.resources@dartmouth.edu or (603) 646-3411.\nStudents can contact Dick's House at dicks.house.health.service@dartmouth.edu or (603) 646-9400.\nWhere can I find out more information about Dartmouth's response to COVID-19?\nInformation is available on the COVID-19 website.\nI'm a supervisor and I've been informed that my employee should not be on campus based on the self-assessment. What should I do?\nInstruct the employee to stay at home and follow guidance on the COVID-19 website about staying away from campus. Also, advise the employee to consult their primary care provider.\nI'm a student's advisor/dean and I've been informed that my student or postdoc should not be on campus based on the self-assessment. What should I do?\nInstruct the student to stay at home and follow guidance on the COVID-19 website about staying away from campus. Also, advise the affected student to consult Dick's House or their medical provider.\nI'm a Dartmouth employee who does not work on campus, but in a different location in New Hampshire. Does this apply to me?\nYes. The screenings are required for all Dartmouth employees reporting to work for Dartmouth outside of their home. This requirement includes any location where you may perform your work, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.\nHow long will the daily screenings be in effect?\nThe daily screening requirement will be in effect until further notice.\nAre contractors and vendors obligated to participate in Dartmouth's health screening?\nThey are required to comply with the screening laws of New Hampshire through their employer.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/new-health-screening-guidelines"},
{"title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "text": "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nFrequently Asked Questions: Returning to Campus for the 2020\u20132021 Academic Year\nStudent Access to Campus\nHousing and Meals\nClasses and Registration Issues\nArrival, Testing, and Contact Tracing\nTuition, Room and Board, and Financial Aid\nProtective Measures and Statement of Community\nTravel and Visitors\nStudent Life\nReturning to Onsite Work\nSTUDENT ACCESS TO CAMPUS\nHow many undergraduate students will be permitted to live on campus this coming year?\nUnder current conditions, we have single-occupancy room assignments available for approximately 2,300 undergraduate students. Following the class-year framework announced by the president and the provost on June 29, each class year will have the opportunity to spend two of four terms on campus during academic year 2020-2021. Each continuing class has one priority term, and the opportunity to rank the remaining available terms in order of preference. New students have priority for on-campus enrollment for the fall and spring terms and will enroll remotely for the winter.\nASSIGNED PRIORITIES\nFALL: Classes of 2024 and 2022\nWINTER: Mixed classes based on preferences and availability\nSPRING: Class of 2021 and Class of 2024\nSUMMER: Class of 2023 and Class of 2022 members who deferred their sophomore summer residence requirement to 2021 summer\nAre students with priority for a term guaranteed housing if they choose to be on-campus that term?\nOn-campus enrollment terms will be determined by class-year priority, preference, and availability. We cannot offer guaranteed housing at this time. The priority/preference form is a first step in determining demand for each of the four terms for academic year 2020-2021. Students are likely to be able to enroll for two on-campus terms, which is the goal of the priority/preference framework. Students will know what their approved on-campus terms will be by the end of July.\nWill students living off-campus be able to take in-person classes?\nMost courses will be offered remotely. To the extent that there are classroom components, capacity will be extremely limited because of substantially reduced safe-occupancy levels adjusted for physical distancing requirements. Students living on campus will receive priority for access to on-campus classrooms and facilities. The institution cannot guarantee the same access to students living off campus.\nHow will the number of terms that a student has already taken remotely impact their permission to return to campus? Some sophomores, for example, will have already taken two remote terms by the beginning of fall term.\nThe priority/preference framework for the 2020\u20132021 academic year provides opportunities for on-campus enrollment for up to two of the four terms as follows:\nCLASS OF 2021: '21s have priority for spring. They will be asked to confirm whether they would like to be here in the spring, and to rank preferences for fall, winter, and summer as their second opportunity for on-campus enrollment. We know most members of the Class of 2021 are graduating at the end of spring, but not all, so summer will be included as an option.\nCLASS OF 2022: '22s have priority for fall. They will be asked to confirm whether they would like to be here in the fall, and to rank preferences for winter, spring, and summer as their second opportunity for on-campus enrollment. Those '22s who received permission to defer the sophomore summer residence requirement to next summer will need to take that into account in their rankings.\nCLASS OF 2023: '23s have priority for sophomore summer. They will be asked to confirm that they will be here in the summer, and to rank preferences for fall, winter, and spring as their second opportunity for an on-campus term.\nCLASS OF 2024: '24s have priority for fall and spring and will enroll remotely for the winter.\nCLASSES OF 2020 and EARLIER: You have not been assigned a priority term. We will ask you to rank fall, winter, spring, and summer in order of preference.\nPlease note that these are priorities and preferences, and not guarantees. Students will complete a form to indicate their preferences within this framework. Students will receive confirmation of assigned on-campus terms by July 31.\nHOUSING AND MEALS\nWhy is the College handling housing this way this year?\nAs is the case at many other institutions, the decision to reduce on-campus enrollment is the result of the public health crisis. We have determined that we need to provide single-occupancy room assignments if we are to host on-campus enrollment, that we need reasonable capacity to relocate and care for those students who have been exposed or become symptomatic with COVID-19, that we need to provide remote instruction for all to provide equity and continuity in the educational experience under these conditions, and that we need to plan for the possibility that the on-campus option may need to end mid-term in the event of a significant outbreak.\nThe health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and the Upper Valley community are our highest priority. Dartmouth and public health experts will be carefully monitoring the use of isolation and quarantine spaces on our campus and infection rates in the local community. In the event of a major health incident, in consultation with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, we would make the decision to move to a fully remote fall term and arrange for the safe return of all students. All of the College's decisions have been informed by our own in-house epidemiological and health care experts and their consultations with counterparts at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, New Hampshire public health officials, CDC resources, peer institutions, other national experts, and ongoing research publication and modeling reviews. As we've seen nationally, our understanding of the science, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is constantly developing.\nThe number of on-campus rooms reserved for isolation and quarantine was determined based on our experiences in winter and spring and our fall-term projections; it is expected that this level of isolation and quarantine capacity will help us avoid the need to shut down the campus during the term.\nIncreasing rates of COVID-19 in many states across the country remind us that this pandemic remains a dynamic situation. Consequently, students must be prepared for the possibility that they will need to leave campus in the event of a health incident or other development that leads to a decision to close, similar to the decision reached in March 2020. Students will be asked to bring to campus only those items that they can take with them if required to leave on short notice.\nHow does Dartmouth's plan compare to other institutions?\nWe face extraordinary and unprecedented challenges in higher education. Faculty and staff have been consulting regularly with their counterparts at other institutions, with colleagues and experts in their respective fields, and within the context of their field-specific professional associations. Each institution is reaching conclusions for 2020-2021 based on a variety of factors that are similar but apply differently to each campus community. Scale, ratio of on- to off-campus students, programs, services, location, and facilities, for example, are different at other schools. Our leadership made the best possible decision it could for the Dartmouth and Upper Valley communities.\nMany people can and have differed on elements of the plan, but the College believes the announced approach is best for Dartmouth students, faculty, staff, and the Upper Valley community. Every possible angle was considered in this process. Senior officers were informed by every message and comment received from students and families, by considerations raised by student leaders from Student Assembly and Paleopitus, and by faculty and staff deeply familiar with the student experience and student concerns. This will continue to be the case going forward.\nDid the College consider using local hotels or temporary housing options?\nThe College thoroughly reviewed these options, including large-scale availability, location, duration, related transportation needs, local business concerns about student occupancy, potential permitting issues and cost and related considerations, leading to the conclusion that neither hotels nor temporary facilities were viable for us this academic year.\nHow will Residential Life handle the fall single-room assignments process?\nOnce the list of students who will be here in the fall is confirmed in mid-late July, Residential Life will communicate with those students about the room assignment process. Students confirmed for enrollment on-campus for fall will receive their single room assignment the week of Aug. 16.\nHow will the UGA system be structured?\nResidential Life is developing plans for UGA hiring and assignments for both remote and on-campus support. More information will be available by the end of July.\nWill my family/friends be permitted to help me move in and out of my dorm room?\nStudents will be asked to arrive with no more than they can take with them on short notice in the event that we are required to shut the campus down as we did in March. Move-in will be a simple process, and one which begins a required 14-day quarantine period. To reduce the risk of virus transmission on campus, we expect there will be limits on the number of people who may accompany a student arriving for fall term. Students enrolled on campus for fall will receive information about move-in processes, timing, and requirements when they receive their housing, arrival date, and related information the week of Aug. 16.\nIs the 14-day mandatory quarantine part of the term for students approved for on-campus enrollment?\nTo promote the health and safety of our students, employees, and local community members, all students, no matter where they have been prior to arrival, will be tested and required to quarantine in their residence halls for the first 14 days. As has been the case since March, Health Service clinicians will determine release dates, which will fall during the second week of the term. Health Service clinicians will also determine throughout the term when individual students are to move from their assigned rooms to one of the quarantine halls (for those identified as exposed through contact tracing) or one of the isolation halls (for those who are symptomatic). As the public health and testing context is constantly evolving this summer, more specific details will be provided in the arrival information that students approved for fall on-campus enrollment will receive the week of Aug. 16. Students approved for fall who decide they don't want to be here or can't comply may choose to shift to remote enrollment from home.\nHow will food be served and consumed on campus in the fall?\nDining services for undergraduates will be in compliance with all applicable state, CDC, and industry guidelines, and COVID-19 task force recommendations. Daily meals will be pre-ordered and delivered for students in self-quarantine and self-isolation. Students enrolled for fall term will receive more detailed information the week of Aug. 16.\nCLASSES AND REGISTRATION ISSUES\nWhen will fall term classes be posted? When will students elect courses?\nThe course timetable will be available for the fall term on July 31. For current students, the fall term course election period will be Aug. 3-11. New students will elect fall courses as usual in September during the virtual orientation program.\nMost courses will be offered remotely. The course delivery mode will be included on the Timetable of Class Meetings and course election/add/drop will occur as normal. The fall term Timetable of Class Meetings will include the course delivery mode for fall course offerings. Given the number of students expected to be on campus and constraints around offering in-person classes, most students will be taking classes remotely.\nPlease monitor the registrar's website, including the following pages, for regular updates about courses, policies, D-Plans, and related topics:\nhttp://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/calendar/term/20_21_term_calendars.html#summer20\nhttp://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/global_health_emergency_information.html\nhttp://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/202009_student_faq.html\nWill faculty hold in-person office hours in the 2020-2021 academic year?\nBecause of office space limitations and physical distancing requirements, and to reduce the risk of virus transmission, students should be prepared for office hours, appointments with deans and other staff, health service appointments, and other meetings with faculty and staff to occur remotely.\nWill students enrolled remotely have access to library resources?\nLibrary staff will continue to provide remote assistance to ensure access to online resources and to support research, teaching, and learning. Students and faculty can:\nBorrowDirect and Interlibrary Loan continue to be suspended at this point; scans from other libraries are limited. Library users will see no overdue fines, in line with standard policy. Recalls of materials will be suspended\nWhen will the College make a decision about study abroad programs?\nThe College cancelled fall term off-campus programs. It is unlikely that off-campus international programs will be offered during the winter term; a decision will be announced before students need to elect fall classes. A decision will also be forthcoming on spring term 2021 off-campus programs.\nIf I have an \"R\" term indicated in my D-Plan. Does that mean I can be on campus that term?\nAn \"R\" term means \"residential or remote.\" An \"R\" indicates you are enrolled at Dartmouth that term and taking courses, whether or not you are on campus. Note that the D-Plan does not reflect or determine whether you may be enrolled on-campus. Priority and preference to be on-campus is a separate process.\nWill students living off-campus be able to take in-person classes?\nMost courses will be offered remotely. To the extent that there are classroom components, capacity will be extremely limited because of substantially reduced safe-occupancy levels adjusted for physical distancing requirements. Students living on campus will receive priority for access to on-campus classrooms and facilities. The institution cannot guarantee the same access to students living off campus.\nWhen will I know about the delivery modes of courses to be offered winter and spring terms 2021?\nAs usual, information about courses offered in future terms is available just prior to the course election period.\nHow do I know what time courses meet in Fall 2020?\nMany courses will meet at the times listed on the Timetable of Class Meetings. Some courses will say \"ARR\" (arranged) and you will need to contact the instructor. The course delivery mode codes will indicate whether the course section is on campus, synchronous, or asynchronous.\nDo classes meet according to the usual Schedule of Class Meetings?\nThe Schedule of Class Meetings times has been slightly adjusted to allow 20 minutes between classes to allow custodial staff to clean classrooms.\nWhat will the grading policy be? Will it be different for '24s?\nAll instruction will be graded in accordance with normal grading policies as outlined in the ORC/Catalog. This includes the Non-Recording Option.\nIf I want to change my D-Plan, how do I do so?\nYou may use the usual methods to change your D-Plan. Either access the D-Plan change tool through DartHub or, if you are requesting a change that is not allowable per faculty legislation, complete a petition for change in enrollment petition and send it to the registrar's office at registrar@dartmouth.edu.\nWill sophomore summer be mandatory this coming year?\nThere has been no change in the sophomore summer residency requirement. As announced previously, both '22s and '23s will be able to fulfill their sophomore summer residency requirement next summer (in 2021) if they have not done so already.\nWill students graduating during the 2020-21 academic year be required to pass the swim test or meet outstanding physical education requirements?\nThe College has suspended the requirements of a successful swim test and all remaining physical education credits for those undergraduate students who are graduating in fall, winter, or spring terms of the 2020-21 academic year and have not yet met these requirements.\nARRIVAL, TESTING, AND CONTACT TRACING\nHow will students get to campus if the Dartmouth Coach is not running?\nPublic transportation has been limited because of state pandemic guidelines. We will know more about public transportation options later this summer and will provide updates to students who will be here in the fall as soon as we have them.\nWill the College provide face masks and hand sanitizer to students?\nYes. More details will be available for fall students in the arrival information they receive the week of Aug. 16.\nWhat kind of COVID-19 testing will take place this fall?\nOur Health/Epidemiology Working Group, led by physicians Mark Reed, director of the College Health Service, and Lisa Adams, a COVID-19 Task Force co-chair who works in the Infectious Disease Section, have consulted with Dartmouth's Department of Epidemiology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), the New Hampshire Department of Health, professional associations, and peer institutions and will continue to assess the viability of developments for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and other risk-reduction strategies. They will continue to work closely with the state health department, DHMC, and other experts over the next six weeks to finalize and prepare to implement our contact tracing and testing protocols. COVID-19 testing using the PCR diagnostic test will begin on arrival for students new to, or returning to, campus and will likely be performed periodically throughout the term.\nUndergraduate students will receive detailed information about these expectations the week of Aug. 16, when they receive information about housing assignments, staggered arrival assignments, and other arrival information. Graduate and professional school students will be contacted by their respective schools with details pertaining to their COVID-19 testing protocols and procedures. Recommendations for testing employees who will be on campus in the fall will also be shared in the coming weeks.\nOur top priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and the greater Upper Valley community. As we open for a reduced number of students and activities on campus, compliance with all College risk-reduction policies will be required. Students who don't wish to participate in COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and other health protocols can choose to enroll remotely.\nIs COVID-19 testing mandatory?\nTesting and compliance with all college health requirements will be mandatory. Many other institutions have announced that testing and contact tracing protocols will be prerequisites for their ability to host students on campus.\nWill I be able to access my COVID-19 test results? Who else will receive them?\nStudents, faculty, and staff who are tested through our initial testing-upon-arrival process will receive their COVID-19 test results with a priority on alerting those who test positive. Individuals will be notified by a clinician and/or public health official. When test results lead to a health requirement to quarantine, isolate, or transport for medical care, test results will be known only to those directly involved in support functions.\nHow will contact tracing on campus work?\nSee above. Undergraduates who will be on campus this fall will receive details regarding COVID-19 testing and contact tracing in arrival information they will receive the week of Aug. 16. Graduate and professional students will receive information prior to the start of their academic year in early August. If contact tracing protocols using cell phones will be required, we will ensure that all students on campus have the ability to participate.\nWill students be required to keep track of/report on the state of their health?\nAll undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students will be required to participate in daily screenings similar to those currently required of all faculty and staff who are on-site. Details will be provided in the arrival materials that undergraduate students will receive the week of Aug. 16 and graduate and professional students will receive prior to the start of their academic year in early August.\nWhat is the current status of COVID-19 cases in the Upper Valley? How many people in the Dartmouth community have tested positive?\nAs of June 29, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NH DHHS) reports a total of 5,638 total cases in New Hampshire, 80 in Grafton county, and 15 cases in Hanover. Of New Hampshire cases, 27% have been in workers in health care settings and 35% have been in residents or staff of long-term care facilities. As of June 25, there are a total of 911 active cases in New Hampshire, concentrated in the southern counties and no current active cases in Hanover. Daily updates including breakdowns by sex, age, race/ethnicity and can be found on the NH DHHS website. Since Dartmouth moved to remote classes for spring term with a limited number of students remaining in residence, there have been no COVID-19 cases among Dartmouth students on campus since early April. These low rates in New Hampshire indicate that there is limited community transition and has allowed the governor's reopening plan to proceed. Despite the evidence of decreasing community transmission, NH DHHS reminds us that New Hampshire communities remain at risk for a resurgence of COVID-19 and the importance of all persons continuing to follow public health guidance including face covering, physical distancing of at least 6 feet, and frequent hand hygiene. Vermont's Department of Health provides similar COVID-19 data and breakdowns.\nWhile Dartmouth has not previously required reporting of COVID-19 testing or cases among faculty, on May 11, Dartmouth instituted an online health screening requirement in accordance with the New Hampshire Governor's Economic Reopening Taskforce's universal guidelines for New Hampshire employers to promote a healthy work environment. Information on this screening process can be found online. This screening tool allows us to address employee concerns, provide support to those who may be experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and ensure that protocols for maintaining a healthy workplace are followed.\nWhat can we expect when our students return in the fall? What do current epidemiologic models predict?\nDartmouth is preparing for a careful and intentional re-opening for the start of the academic year. All epidemiologic models are highly sensitive to assumptions and indicate that, in accordance with New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services guidance, continued adherence to current public health measures is important to keep our campus and broader community safe. The guidance for individuals\u2014both students and employees\u2014is described in detail at https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/.\nTUITION, ROOM AND BOARD, AND FINANCIAL AID\nWhen will current students be receiving their financial aid package for the 2020-2021 academic year?\nFinancial aid packages will be available in early August.\nHow will financial aid work?\nFinancial aid awards meet 100% of a student's demonstrated need. A higher-cost term (e.g. on-campus learning) generally results in a higher scholarship; a lower-cost term (e.g. remote learning) may result in a lower scholarship, but a student's bill will also be lower. In both cases, the College will meet 100% of the student's demonstrated need.\nHow will work-study awards be impacted?\nDartmouth continues to wait for federal guidance on how to handle work-study positions in the new academic year. Once the government announces guidance on work positions, Dartmouth will be able to better support students.\nWhat will the charges be for room, board, and tuition?\nCharges for the new academic year will be posted as usual.\nWhat is the College's refund policy?\nThe College's posted COVID-19 Summer Refund Policy can be found here. The refund policy for the fall term will be posted by the week of Aug. 16.\nWill tuition be reduced for students who decide not to be on campus?\nThe provost has announced that there will be no reduction in tuition for remote learning. Full tuition will be charged for all enrolled students whether they are enrolled and residing on campus or taking courses remotely. The most fundamental component of delivering a Dartmouth education to our students is the faculty who teach the courses and the resources that support them. Tuition at its current rate is necessary just to pay for the courses students are taking, whether those courses are conducted in person or remotely.\nPROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENROLLMENT POLICIES\nHow can the College encourage and monitor physical distancing in student social spaces?\nAll students on campus and living locally will be required to agree to COVID-19 behavioral requirements, including that students who fail to comply will lose the privilege of being enrolled on campus and will be required to leave. Our ability to maintain on-campus living and learning options is dependent on our collective commitment to promoting the health and safety of the campus and greater Upper Valley community. Students who cannot meet these expectations may choose to enroll remotely, or not at all.\nWhat happens if students violate institutional protocols?\nStudents who fail to comply with their agreement to abide by College COVID-19 behavioral requirements will lose the privilege of on-campus enrollment. They will be required to leave campus and the Upper Valley and continue the term remotely. Separately, they may also be subject to disciplinary action following our normal standards and processes.\nWhat protective measures will be in place this fall?\nMaintaining recommended public health measures is absolutely critical to protecting the health of our campus and local community. These recommendations must be strictly adhered to and will be strictly enforced. They include:\nCloth face coverings\nDartmouth requires all persons to wear cloth face coverings at all times when using or accessing shared or communal spaces at any Dartmouth worksite and also when a minimum of 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to maintain. This requirement is designed to protect the health and safety of the Dartmouth community by reducing the risk of coronavirus transmission. Read the entire policy for further information.\nPhysical distancing, which means:\nTrying to stay home and only go out for essential reasons such as purchasing food and medicine.\nAvoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible.\nRemaining alert for respiratory symptoms (a cough or shortness of breath) and fever.\nPracticing strict respiratory etiquette and hygiene. This includes covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not available.\nLimited gatherings: Limit all gatherings to under 10 people. Even in small gatherings it is safest to practice physical distancing and wear a face covering.\nWhat will happen if there is a significant health event/COVID-19 outbreak on campus or in the Upper Valley?\nStudents should be prepared for the possibility that they will need to leave campus in the event of an outbreak that leads to a decision to close, similar to the decision reached in March 2020. Students will be asked to bring to campus only those items that they can take with them if required to leave on short notice.\nWill I be required to sign a waiver?\nIn August, students living on campus or locally for the fall term will receive details of Dartmouth's institutional policies and practices for reducing the risk of transmission, promoting the health and safety of students, faculty, staff and the greater Upper Valley community, and supporting and promoting the College's academic mission during the pandemic. Students will be advised about their role in these efforts, including compliance expectations for the 2020-2021 academic year. The response to COVID-19 is a shared responsibility. The Supplemental Undergraduate COVID-19 Enrollment and Housing Policy for academic year 2020-2021 will require students to acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply before they will be permitted to return to campus.\nMany other schools are welcoming back all their students. Why is Dartmouth being selective?\nEvery college or university is working to make the best and most informed decisions for their own campus and greater community. Some schools have announced there will be no residential component. Some have announced there will be more limited on-campus opportunities given the need to reduce the risk of transmission by reducing campus density, particularly in congregate living conditions. As the provost has indicated, the health and safety of the campus and greater community are our highest priorities.\nGiven the configuration and scale of our buildings, we have identified the number of rooms that could be assigned for single occupancy after designating Maxwell, Channing Cox, the Lodge, French, Judge and the Choates for self-isolation and quarantine needs. We will host the number of students we can accommodate in single-room assignments until further notice.\nWe've heard from many students, faculty, and staff that one of the most difficult things about the past four months has been the unknown and the inability to plan. We are announcing this full-year approach now to provide everyone with a framework for their own planning. If COVID-19 conditions relax and we are able to invite more students back to campus for winter, spring, or summer, we will do so. If COVID-19 conditions become more restrictive and exceed our capacity to manage them with two classes in residence, we have to be prepared to shut the campus down, send everyone home, and continue teaching and learning remotely. The good news is that we are able to give everyone the opportunity to come back at some point during this year if they wish to be here.\nHow will the College facilitate the safe use of academic buildings?\nThe College has determined the reduced occupancy of every classroom based on physical distancing requirements. Entry and exit protocols and paths of travel will be designated for all buildings and all classrooms. Additional passing time has been added to the class schedule. Students will be required to follow those expectations and will lose the privilege of on-campus enrollment if they fail to do so.\nHow do you plan to encourage social distancing in student social spaces?\nAll students enrolled on campus for fall will be required to read, acknowledge, and comply with all applicable health guidelines, including physical distancing, wearing face coverings, limits to group gatherings, and other requirements. Students who fail to comply will lose their privilege of on-campus enrollment and will be required to leave. Contact tracing protocols will be shared with students in the arrival materials they will receive the week of Aug.16.\nDid Dartmouth consider using student \"pods\" to allow small groups of students more flexibility?\nWe did consider the pod concept but decided that it would be difficult to implement in our campus community, and therefore would be of limited benefit. Dartmouth students have made it clear in the past that they do not want the College to influence how they choose their friend groups. We know that students have many identities, and that one motivation for returning to an on-campus term is the opportunity to interact across a wide variety of friend groups and classmates. We would not propose to limit students' ability to engage with one another as long as they are following face covering, physical distancing, group gathering, and other health guidelines. The \"pod\" concept limits interactions to very small groups that live, eat, and learn together. Students might certainly choose to limit their interactions to a small group of students, but the College will not impose it.\nTRAVEL AND VISITORS\nCan students have visitors to their room on campus?\nStudents will not be permitted to have visitors in College facilities. For the benefit of everyone, students will be expected to follow all specified health guidelines to retain the privilege of on-campus enrollment. Students may interact with others and will be allowed to meet in small groups of less than nine people while wearing face coverings and maintaining a 6-foot distance. Weather permitting, such small meetings of students would be best conducted outside.\nWho is permitted to be on campus?\nGiven the risk of transmission and restrictions on travel, and to protect everyone's health, visitors who have not received specific authorization to be at Dartmouth should not come to campus.\nCan students leave campus for personal travel?\nStudents who wish to enroll on campus will not be permitted to travel. Failure to follow the COVID-19 requirements will result in revocation of the privilege of enrolling on campus and living in College facilities. Specific details will be provided the week of Aug. 16 when students approved for on-campus enrollment receive arrival information. Students should be prepared to remain on campus throughout the term, and to engage in employment, internships, interviews, and other activities virtually. Following the initial 14-day quarantine, we encourage students to explore the trails and hiking paths that are accessible within walking distance of campus.\nIf there is a chance that travel outside of the Upper Valley will be necessary during the term, students will have the flexibility to travel if enrolled remotely from home. For the protection of students, faculty, staff, and the Upper Valley community, students will lose the privilege of on-campus enrollment if they violate travel restrictions.\nSTUDENT LIFE\nWhat kinds of activities and programs will be available?\nStudent organizations and programs have developed creative virtual opportunities to stay connected, participate in activities together from all over the world, and form new friendships. While nothing can replace the experience of being together on campus, Dartmouth will continue to do all we can to support alternative ways of maintaining connections and building relationships virtually. Student leaders and student organizations have been meeting with the Dean of the College and Student Life staff throughout the past few months. The dean's Student Advisory Board will work with the dean on community-building strategies throughout the year.\nWill the library, the gym and other campus facilities be available?\nFacilities and Environmental Health and Safety staff have been working with the library and other campus facilities to assess reduced occupancy levels for buildings and rooms given physical distancing and group gathering limitations. They are also assessing paths of travel for entry and exit, seating arrangements, cleaning protocols, and other factors that will provide the framework for the use of facilities in September. This work is well underway and will continue to be informed by new developments prior to the start of fall term. Students approved for on-campus fall enrollment will receive facilities-use details in the arrival information that will be shared the week of Aug. 16. If students approved for on-campus fall enrollment decide that they would prefer not to be on campus after receiving that information, they may shift to remote enrollment from home.\nHow will Greek-life organizations be affected by these new protocols? Will Greek recruitment (rush) take place this fall?\nThe Office of Greek Life has been meeting with house advisors and has begun to discuss parameters for fall occupancy of Greek-letter organization facilities, both College- and privately-owned. Students approved for fall on-campus enrollment will be eligible to live in Greek facilities in single-room assignments similar to those applicable in the residence halls. Students approved for fall on-campus enrollment will receive more information about the assignments process by the end of July. For the 2020-2021 academic year, there will be no in-person recruitment activities, and significantly reduced group gathering limitations. All student organizations, including Greek-letter organizations, will be required to follow College COVID-19 operational and behavioral requirements.\nWhat about House Communities and Living Learning Communities?\nHouse Communities will be functioning virtually this year. As always, involvement in House activities will be on the basis of membership rather than room assignment or physical location. Living Learning Communities will be fully virtual this year as well. Students will have the opportunity to apply to participate, but involvement will not be residentially based.\nWill athletes be given preference to return early this fall? Will there be sports competition?\nThe Ivy League has announced that all fall sports have been postponed, with no date set for resuming the conference's athletic events. Our Athletic Department will communicate directly to student athletes when more information is available.\nWhat will happen to community events this fall such as homecoming, fall alumni reunions, or performances and exhibits at the Hopkins Center and the Hood Museum?\nWe do not expect to be hosting large groups or traditional events on campus during the 2020-2021 academic year. All activities will be in compliance with College COVID-19 guidelines, including reduced occupancies for social distancing, group size, limitations and related risk reduction strategies.\nRETURNING TO ON-SITE WORK\nWhen will staff return to on-site work?\nMany essential employees have been working on campus this spring and summer to maintain our facilities and support our faculty and students. As on-site activity increases this fall, many more will return to campus. In order to fulfill our mission of teaching, scholarship, and research while maintaining a low population density, we will ask certain groups of people to return to work at different times.\nResearch staff and faculty have begun returning to their labs and offices while following detailed health protocols. Graduate students, whose research often depends on lab or clinical access, and who live predominantly off-campus or in single-apartment residences, will begin returning in early August. Undergraduates will begin coming to campus in September. Administrative and other non-research staff who can perform their jobs effectively online may be asked to continue working remotely through the fall and possibly into winter. We are grateful for their flexibility.\nWill Dartmouth reopen the child-care center?\nThe College is working to reopen the Dartmouth College Child Care Center later this summer in a way that can safely accommodate as many families as possible.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/academic-year-2020-21-return-campus-plan/frequently-asked-questions"},

{"title": "Workplace Policies and Resources", "text": "CHANGES IN WORK DUE TO COVID-19\nDartmouth places the highest priority on the health, safety, and well-being of our community, while protecting the continuity of academic programs and essential services. Dartmouth workplace policies will be updated as circumstances related to the COVID-19 virus change. Faculty and staff should continue to check this page for updates. Questions can be directed to the Office of Human Resources.\nDartmouth's priorities in setting these workplace policies are to:\nMaintain a safe and healthy workplace, including minimizing the transmission of contagious disease;\nSustain academic programs and operational continuity;\nEncourage a culture of fairness, open communications, and concern for the well-being of our faculty and staff.\nMost Important Actions to Take Now:\nAll faculty and staff are urged to take basic preventive measures to avoid exposure to or infection by the virus causing COVID-19. To encourage social distancing, employees who are able to do their work from home and have the necessary technology are encouraged to do so, though there is no requirement to do so at this time. A Temporary Telecommuting Agreement (PDF) should be discussed with supervisors Temporary Telecommuting Agreement For those whose work is capable of being performed from home but who lack the technology, they and their manager should begin discussing how to enable that work remotely and complete a(PDF), if applicable. For those whose work requires them to be on campus, and for all who choose to be on campus, they should use good hygiene and social distancing. Contact the Employee Assistance Program at 844-216-8308 for help with feelings of stress or anxiety about these events.\nWorkplace Policies, Updated June 18, 2020\nWell Employees: All faculty and staff, even those who are well, are encouraged to work from home if they are able and have the necessary technology to do so. Well employees may work on campus unless they have been: caring for someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and the employee has been instructed by a medical professional to self-quarantine ; traveling internationally (including Canada); traveling on public conveyances outside of New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine; traveling on a cruise within the last 14 days; or instructed to refrain from attending work by Dartmouth College Health Services or by public health officials.\nSick Employees: Faculty and staff who have symptoms c onsistent with COVID-19 must stay home and not work on campus . Those Dartmouth employees designated as essential who have either been diagnosed with COVID-19 or think they may have had COVID-19 can return to on-campus work if they have: had no fever for at least 72 hours (without the use of medications that reduce fevers), other symptoms that have improved, and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Additionally, employees should follow the guidance of their health care provider and the local health department (if applicable). This guidance is in accordance with information from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. In cases of sickness, paid time off/benefit time should be used.\nonsistent with COVID-19 must stay home and not work on campus Workers at Higher Risk: Employees who believe they may be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions are urged to consult their physician about steps they can take to protect their health. These may include requesting a temporary change in job location, hours, assignment or duties, or implementation of additional protective measures to reduce their exposure to others or chances of being infected.\nrequest an alternative work arrangement through Dartmouth's process for seeking disability-based accommodations. A doctor's note or other appropriation documentation will be required to support the request. If an employee is at risk for complications from COVID-19 and their physician agrees that increased social distancing in the workplace is prudent, the employee should contact their supervisor and/or HR consultant torequest an alternative work arrangement through Dartmouth's process for seeking disability-based accommodations. A doctor's note or other appropriation documentation will be required to support the request. Except for employees who request a change in job circumstances due to underlying health conditions, employees will generally not be reassigned to new duties, locations, or roles or be provided with paid sick/release time solely to address concerns about the potential for COVID-19 infection.\nAdditional Workplace Guidance for Managers\nManagers and supervisors are asked to support Dartmouth's encouragement of social distancing by facilitating work from home for employees whose jobs are suited to this mode of working, including by taking reasonable steps to enable access to the necessary technology to do so. Managers and supervisors, including faculty who supervise staff, must not pressure others to come to work on campus if they are ill or need to stay at home to care for ill dependents. Though remote working is not required for all employees at this time, staff and faculty may be required to stay away from campus because of close contact with someone confirmed to have COVID-19 or travel history (e.g., to a CDC Level 2-3 country ), as noted above.\nGiven Dartmouth's interest in maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all, managers and supervisors (with the support and involvement of local HR as needed) should ask employees who are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness to go home and stay home until 72 hours after they are free of symptoms. In these instances, any sickness paid time off/benefit time should be used.\nAll supervisors, managers, and directors should create or update their business continuity plans to ensure essential functions can continue to operate under possible impacts from the COVID-19 virus.\nHR consultants will be hosting regularly scheduled conference calls to update managers and address questions regarding these policies.\nPotential Additional Policy Changes\nIf public health conditions worsen, Dartmouth's workplace policies may be further amended. This would be done to address the effects of more widespread illness or absences, more frequent needs for self-observation or self-quarantine, disruption of care arrangements or Dartmouth's priorities for pay continuity. Faculty and staff will be notified as promptly as possible of such changes.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/workplace-policies-and-resources"},

{"title": "Email From President Hanlon and Provost Helble", "text": "June 29, 2020\nTo the Dartmouth community,\nMarch 2020 seems like a lifetime ago. The absence of students, faculty, and staff enlivening the Hanover Plain makes us eager to be together again on campus, pursuing our mission of teaching, scholarship, and research. With that as our goal, we have been working on a plan to bring back to campus as many of us as possible this fall in a way that is safe, sustainable, and pragmatic. Most of all, our commitment to the excellence and distinctiveness of the Dartmouth experience continues, regardless of the form that experience may take.\nWe write to share current information about our plan and what we expect to have in place for the entire 2020-21 academic year. Many details are evolving and will be updated over the course of the coming weeks based on emerging data, ongoing modeling of disease progression, and regional, national, and global events.\nSAFETY FIRST\nAs we plan for the return of faculty, students, and staff to campus, the health and safety of our community is our top priority. New Hampshire has been successful in containing and managing the spread of COVID-19, but we know that a second wave of infection is likely and that it will require a rapid and comprehensive response within our community. There is much we still do not know about this disease. Our plans, therefore, must address risks to the future health and safety of our students, who will come to Hanover from around the globe, as well as for the health of our faculty, our staff and the Upper Valley community that surrounds them.\nOver the past four months, our COVID-19 Task Force and its various working groups have been consulting with medical professionals, faculty and alumni experts, and state officials, and monitoring public health guidance to recommend an approach to the next academic year that navigates a careful balance among multiple considerations: preserving our students' educational experience, limiting the spread of disease, and offering the support systems required for new infections. Effective processes for virus testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine will be critical to our preparedness. Our Health Management Working Group is finalizing recommendations for an institutional plan that will guide these activities in partnership with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.\nUNDERGRADUATES WILL RETURN TO CAMPUS BY TERM\nIn order to facilitate the physical distancing needed in our classrooms and residences, and to be able to reserve sufficient housing for quarantine or self-isolation in the event of a resurgence of infection, we must reduce the number of students on our campus. Dartmouth has successfully faced this type of challenge before. When we transitioned to coeducation in 1972, President John Kemeny had to determine how to accommodate more students without adding beds. Thus, the D-Plan was born. Now we face the challenge of determining how to accommodate the same number of students with what are, in effect, fewer available beds and classroom space. Today's situation calls for a new D-Plan.\nWe therefore plan to bring back to campus more than half of our undergraduates for the fall term and anticipate doing so for each subsequent term through the summer of 2021. This will give each student the opportunity to spend two terms enrolled on campus this academic year and to enroll via distance learning from home for one or both of the remaining two terms.\nIn the interest of class cohesion, the Class of 2024 will receive priority to be on campus as a residential cohort for the fall and spring terms and will enroll for an off-campus winter term. International students in the Class of 2024 who have difficulty securing a visa in time to begin the fall term will be permitted to enroll off-campus. Other undergraduates will be able to express their preferences for their two residential terms, with the understanding that the '23s will receive priority to be on campus for the 2021 summer term (along with the '22s who chose to defer their 2020 sophomore summer because of COVID-19). Members of the Class of 2022 will receive priority for the fall 2020 term and '21s for the spring 2021 term. We are committed to working with high-need students as we did in the spring and summer terms and will provide more information soon. No enrolled student is required to be on campus for any term and may elect to spend the entire year enrolled off-campus.\nDartmouth will begin the undergraduate fall term on Sept. 14 as scheduled. We will shortly share the move-in dates, which will reflect a 14-day quarantine for all students upon arrival. We will ask undergraduates who are on campus to depart as soon as fall term classes end. Final exams for all undergraduates (and most graduate students) will be held remotely the week after Thanksgiving, allowing students to depart campus several days earlier than Thanksgiving break and avoid the anticipated peak travel period.\nUndergraduate students will receive additional information from the dean of the College regarding these and other topics by email today.\nSTUDENT CAMPUS RESIDENCES\nThis coming year we will expect all undergraduates who are on campus to live in rooms that have private, single sleeping spaces (individual rooms and two-room doubles) in order to maintain appropriate physical distancing. This reduces the number of undergraduate housing spaces available in any one term but will limit the risk of disease transmission among students and provide quiet study space, which will be particularly helpful for remote learning. Residential Life will be in touch in mid-July with students who enroll for the fall. Housing assignments, assigned arrival dates, and related arrival information will be provided to all fall term residents the week of August 16.\nGRADUATE HOUSING\nWe do not expect major residential changes to graduate student housing, which already offers single-occupancy bedrooms, both on and off campus. Some adjustments in graduate housing may be needed in response to public health needs.\nTEACHING AND LEARNING\nThe majority of undergraduate instruction and faculty office hours will be held remotely this fall, although some in-person classes will be offered on campus. Physical distancing requirements of 6 feet between people mean that we will have substantially reduced classroom space available to students. We pride ourselves on our commitment to teaching and we view the challenge of doing so remotely\u2014for however long that it is required\u2014as mission-critical.\nIndividual graduate and professional schools will provide guidance on what will be taught remotely and what will be offered in person. Calendars, degree requirements, and academic procedures in our graduate and professional programs may vary, and students should follow the guidance provided by their school.\nCAMPUS LIFE\nThe reality of COVID-19 means that the campus environment will be very different this fall. There will be strict limitations on gatherings, social activities, and lectures. We will have new protocols for using campus buildings and common spaces, restricted travel with self-quarantine protocols, contact tracing, a requirement to wear face coverings everywhere but private spaces, enhanced cleaning procedures, staggered scheduling and reconfigured workspaces, and limited access to buildings. The College library will be open to the Dartmouth community of students, faculty, and staff.\nEveryone coming to live on campus will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. As part of a collective commitment to community, all those working and living on-site will be required to participate in daily health screening via an app or website. We will also mandate virus testing upon any return to campus and regularly thereafter. We are mindful of the need to maintain individual privacy, and test results will be made available only to those who need access in order to address this aspect of community health. This will likely include testing of employees coming to campus who have traveled outside the area before the start of the term.\nDespite the precautions that must be taken for students to be on campus, we feel it is important to continue to provide them with Dartmouth's extraordinary sense of place. Being in an academic environment in this setting helps promote learning, the exchange of ideas, and thoughtful reflection and will help strengthen our sense of community.\nATHLETICS\nThe Ivy League has not yet announced a final decision on fall athletic competition. That announcement is expected in July. Our Athletic Department will communicate directly to student athletes when more information is available.\nRETURNING TO ON-SITE WORK\nFor the most up-to-date information on the status of when and how employees can return to work, including the plans for the Dartmouth Child Care Center, please visit the COVID-19 website https://dartmouth.edu/covid19.\nAs a reminder, any or all of our plans may be changed if we experience a significant health event on our campus, or if required by federal or state mandates. Conversely, successful disease prevention or treatment efforts\u2014such as the availability of a vaccine\u2014could also shift the landscape. We intend to evaluate the situation on a termly basis and adapt our plans accordingly. Our later start date means we can look to the experiences of other schools to help guide our decisions.\nWe join those who want to return to the important work and profound educational experiences provided by a fully residential year at Dartmouth, and we look forward to a time when that is possible. In the meantime, we have created a plan that adapts to the realities we face. We will share additional detailed information with relevant groups and people as important decisions are made and we will update the guidance on our COVID-19 website (https://dartmouth.edu/covid19). A list of frequently asked questions is also available on the site at https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/academic-year-2020-21-return-campus-plan/frequently-asked-questions. In addition, we will continue to stream our Community Conversations webcast on alternating Wednesdays through July and possibly later, with the next livestream scheduled for July 8, so that you can ask questions and get updates about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operation (https://news.dartmouth.edu/community-conversations). Questions can also be directed to the COVID-19 Task Force at COVID-19.task.force@dartmouth.edu.\nAgain, as difficult as it is to make these adjustments to our lives and learning, they are important measures to safeguard the health of our community while continuing to preserve our students' academic experience. Thank you for your patience, perseverance, and care for others. We are in this as a community and we will get through it as a community.\nDespite the uncertainty and constraints imposed by the pandemic, and regardless of the medium in which we educate our students, we are dedicated to providing all of them with a rich and rewarding experience in the coming year and supporting our faculty and staff in their important work. We can't wait to welcome you back to campus.\nSincerely,\nPhilip J. Hanlon '77, President\nJoseph J.

{"title": "Staff Frequently Asked Questions", "text": "Staff Frequently Asked Questions\nThe Office of Human Resources is committed to providing updates on the latest developments and how they affect our people and our workplace. Below you'll find answers to some commonly asked questions. We will share answers to more of your questions as the COVID-19 situation evolves. We will host a virtual supervisor roundtable each Wednesday at noon to answer additional questions that arise. To join the Zoom meeting, use this link or call in using 646-558-8656 with meeting ID 680 162 496.\nWhere can I find information on the hiring freeze announced on April 3?\nThe Office of Human Resources has information on the COVID-19 hiring freeze. The HR site includes the process for requesting recruitment and review of a position thought to be of critical need. It also has an FAQ on the hiring freeze.\nHow can I get technology help?\nWe have redeployed our IT resources to triple the size of the team dedicated to fielding support request for remote learning platforms and we will be offering extended support hours. ITC has compiled a variety of resources to help employees with the change to remote teaching, learning, and working. You can find a variety of information to help with your technical needs.\nWhat precautions are in place for employees who continue to work on campus?\nWe are modifying work schedules to require fewer individuals performing essential services to be on campus at any one time. Our environmental health and safety team provides guidance for those who do need to be on campus about best practices to protect themselves and recommending appropriate protective equipment. The CDC also provides guidance on this topic.\nWhat should I do if I'm concerned about COVID-19 exposure?\nThe CDC website has excellent resources for understanding community-related exposure. The information is available on the CDC site. If you have concerns about your own health or whether you should self-quarantine or isolate, please call your primary care provider.\nHow can I disinfect my facility?\nIf you are concerned about your office space, the CDC provides information on keeping your environment clean. If you have concerns about cleaning your facility, contact Dartmouth Work Control at 603-646-2508.\nHow can I get support during this difficult time?\nSpeak with a professional counselor at GuidanceResources, at 844-216-8308. GuidanceResources is Dartmouth's online Employee Assistance Program (EAP) partner and offers confidential telephone counseling 24 hours a day, every day.\nFaculty and staff can also contact EAP Counselor Sharon Morisi. She is available via Zoom and telephone during normal business hours and offers support to supervisors who are assisting staff. Confidential virtual counseling is also available to students, faculty, and staff with Daveen Litwin, the Tucker Center chaplain, and with the United Campus Ministry advisers of multiple faith traditions. Email Litwin for an appointment. Resources are also available at Wellness at Dartmouth.\nPAY AND WORK EXPECTATIONS\nDoes pay continuation apply to all Dartmouth employees?\nAll regular non-student employees will continue to be paid their base salary or rate of pay through July 31, 2020. Temporary, seasonal, or per diem employees will be paid for hours worked.\nWill grant funded employees also receive pay continuation?\nThere are a number of external sources that fund the work of many Dartmouth employees. Each of the external sources is providing guidance that should be reviewed. Updated guidance will be provided by the Office of Sponsored Projects.\nWill I be expected to use my new banks of personal and vacation time before using Other Lost Time, once those banks are replenished for the new fiscal year?\nAs an employer, Dartmouth must make sound financial decisions while also supporting employees during this unprecedented situation. As good stewards of our resources, it is prudent to ask employees to use their available banks for personal and vacation time before incurring additional compensation expenses.\nHowever, for the first pay period of the fiscal year (June 21\u2013July 4) hourly paid employees who are not working will not be required to use their new banks of personal and vacation time, other than for scheduled vacation days, and may continue to record lost time using the \"Other Lost Time\" category.\nBeginning July 5, all employees who are not working will be expected to use available personal or vacation time before using the \"Other Lost Time\" category for time away from work.\nWill I be paid my regular weekly hours even if there is not enough work for me to do?\nYes, hourly paid employees will be paid their base rate of pay for their March 18 effective scheduled hours per week even if they only work a portion of those hours. For the first pay period of the fiscal year (June 21\u2013July 4) hourly paid employees who are not working will not be required to use their new banks of personal and vacation time, other than for scheduled vacation days, and may continue to record lost time using the \"Other Lost Time\" category.\nBeginning July 5, all employees who are not working will be expected to use their available personal and vacation time in accordance with policy when not working. If additional time is needed beyond available benefit time, Dartmouth has committed to paying employees through the end of July to support our employees through the COVID 19 public health situation. If you have no benefit time available, \"Other Lost Time\" should be used on your time sheet and will require your supervisor's approval. \"Other Lost Time\" will be paid using the base rate (without shift differential or overtime).\nHow should I be recording my hours?\nExcept as noted otherwise in this guidance with respect to the pay period June 21\u2013July 4, when staff are remote but not working, they are expected to record vacation time and personal time. If a staff member has exhausted their personal and vacation time, they can record their time against \"Other Lost Time\" and continue to be paid. If they are working remotely, time should be recorded as it otherwise would.\nWill I continue to receive my shift differential, overtime pay or other hourly pay premiums?\nShift differentials, overtime, or other hourly pay premiums will only be applied for time worked that meet the criteria for the premium pay rates.\nWhat does this mean for the expectations of my work?\nAll employees are expected to work when work is available. Failure to do so will result in corrective action. Ask your supervisor for specifics related to the work you are expected to complete.\nAs a supervisor, what does this mean for what I should expect of my employees?\nAll employees are expected to work when work is available. Failure to do so will result in corrective action. Supervisors should clearly communicate expectations to their employees on a frequent basis and ensure that work is being performed to meet those expectations. HR consultants are available to support supervisors/managers needing assistance in communicating expectations.\nWhat if the work I'm expected to do is on campus and not everyone is needed each day?\nSupervisors and managers are establishing rotating schedules to cover the work needing to be performed on campus. Each member of the team is expected to participate in the established rotations. Failure to do so except for the reasons noted in this guidance may lead to corrective action.\nWhat about using my vacation and personal time?\nIf work is not available, you are caring for others, or you are unable to perform the work due to your own illness, personal and vacation time should be depleted before using \"Other Lost Time,\" except that for the first pay period of the fiscal year (June 21\u2013July 4) hourly paid employees who are not working will not be required to use their new banks of personal and vacation time, other than for scheduled vacation days, and may continue to record lost time using the \"Other Lost Time\" category.\nIf you are working, whether on campus or remotely, personal and vacation time should be used for instances when you need time for appointments, to take scheduled time away from work, or other commitments. Employees are expected to discuss and coordinate the usage of paid time off (PTO) with their supervisors.\nWhat if I am unable to report to work or complete work remotely because I am caring for children or family?\nFor the first pay period of the fiscal year (June 21\u2013July 4), hourly paid employees who are not working will not be required to use their new banks of personal and vacation time, other than for scheduled vacation days, and may continue to record lost time using the \"Other Lost Time\" category. Beginning July 5, all employees who are not working will be expected to use available personal or vacation time before using the \"Other Lost Time\" category for time away from work.\nAll employees are expected to communicate with their supervisors regarding schedules and work expectations.\nWhat if I am unable to report to work or complete work remotely because I have underlying health concerns?\nEmployees who seek a work accommodation due to an impairment, serious health condition, or other circumstance that may be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Family and Medical Leave Act should contact their health care provider about appropriate protective measures and documentation. Work with your supervisor and the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity (IDE) on the accommodation process. Appropriate medical documentation will be required to support requests.\nWhat if I am in an hourly paid position and have already scheduled my vacation time during for the first pay period (June 21\u2013July 4)? Can I use \"Other Lost Time\" instead of my new vacation balances?\nThe extension of the ability to use the \"Other Lost Time\" category into the first pay period (June 21\u2013July 4) is intended to provide additional relief and the preservation of some paid time off for fiscal year 21 for community members who are unable to work due to COVID-19 related circumstances, such as being unable to report to work due to a lack of available work, the need to care for children or family, or due to one's own illness. Those who are able to work and have elected to take vacation time are expected to use their new vacation time balances during this first pay period.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/staff-frequently-asked-questions"},

See the latest New Hampshire guidance for employees and travel. (PDF)\nAccording to this guidance, anyone who has traveled internationally (including to Canada), traveled on public conveyances outside of New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine, or who has been on a cruise, should quarantine for 14 days when they return and before returning to campus. Public conveyances include, but are not limited to, airplanes, trains, subways, buses, boats, vans, ride-shares, or taxis used by the public, whether for compensation or not. Public conveyances do not include privately owned vehicles used for private purposes.\nThose who can self-quarantine and work remotely may do so. If you are traveling outside of New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine and are not using a public conveyance, no quarantine is required upon your return. If traveling, individuals should check and follow quarantine requirements in their final destination as well. We recognize that travel recommendations and quarantine requirements vary by state, including between New Hampshire and Vermont. Everyone is expected to follow their state's quarantine requirements outside of their work hours.\nDartmouth-supported international and domestic travel remains prohibited for faculty and staff at this time with an option to apply for an exemption from your dean/supervisor. Personal travel, including domestic travel outside New Hampshire and Vermont, is strongly discouraged due to possible self-quarantine requirements upon arrival at your destination, following your return home, or both.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of travel restrictions, at this time we are prohibiting all Dartmouth-sponsored international and domestic travel for staff, faculty, and students. We encourage finding alternate means of conducting business, such as teleconferencing.\nPersonal travel, both domestic and international, is also discouraged. Students who are departing campus to return home are exempt from this restriction. If you are traveling within the United States, please check the state and territorial health department websites for the latest information.\nQuestions: Students and their families should contact Student Affairs at 603-646-2980 with questions about travel. Faculty and staff should email the COVID-19 Task Force at COVID-19.task.force@dartmouth.edu.\nTravel Waivers: All Dartmouth-sponsored international and domestic travel has been suspended due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The link for Travel Waivers has been temporarily disabled.\nTravel Exceptions: Faculty and staff may petition their dean or vice president for a travel exception to the travel prohibition if they feel that the proposed travel is essential for Dartmouth. The process for a travel exception petition will include the several steps outlined on Global Dartmouth.\nAthletics: The Ivy League presidents announced their unanimous decision to cancel all spring athletics competitions and practices for the remainder of the academic year. In light of the pandemic, and the growing number of schools that have moved classes online for the rest of their semesters, it is no longer feasible for these competitions and practices to continue. This is a heavy blow to our student-athletes, who have sacrificed and trained so hard in their respective sports, and we regret the impact of these circumstances. Winter teams and student-athletes who have qualified for postseason play will be able to participate in league competitions.\nTravel Advisories: Please visit the CDC Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel for the latest updates.\nTravel Registry\nAll Dartmouth-sponsored international and domestic travel has been suspended due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Personal travel, including domestic travel outside of New Hampshire and Vermont, is strongly discouraged, due to possible self-quarantine requirements. For this reason, we are temporarily discontinuing the travel registry.

{"title": "Important Updates", "text": "Topics\nResearch Ramp-Up Status, July 7, 2020\nIn order to limit the spread of COVID-19, Dartmouth ramped-down on-campus research activity beginning on March 23. Except for COVID-19 research and some time-critical studies, remaining scholarly work shifted to remote formats. As local disease prevalence has come under control, we have pursued a phased restoration of limited on campus-research activity, subject to detailed protocols to ensure campus health and safety, including physical distancing, disinfection, and the use of face coverings.\nPhase 1 started on May 26, permitting one person per research group. Based on positive experience, Phase 2 was launched on July 1, which allows multiple researchers per group, subject to physical distancing and other requirements. In parallel, research hours have been expanded, and minimal office access provided for non-laboratory scholarship. Starting on July 8, the libraries initiated limited in-person access to research collections. In addition to supporting our scholarly mission, restoration of research activity has allowed us to test the deployment of new systems that are going to be required in the future.\nIn the Phase 2 research ramp-up, incremental improvements have continued on several fronts, including extensions of laboratory opening hours and mechanisms for requesting office access across disciplines. We are evaluating conditions for the restoration of human-subjects research, further support for other academic areas, and continuing enhancements of research activity.\nThe goal is to maximize Dartmouth's ability to contribute to human knowledge, under conditions that protect the health and safety of our community. As long as our risk-level is \"highly limited\" or \"limited,\" it remains important to limit occupancy. Thus, without exception, those who can perform their work remotely should continue to do so. Phase 2 permits each research group to schedule multiple individuals to be on campus at the same time.\nAll laboratory research activity must comply with the Guidelines for Reopening Laboratory-Based Research: Phase 2. Numerous additional requirements apply, including New Hampshire state guidelines, as well as Dartmouth and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center guidelines. Central to these requirements are practices designed to minimize the likelihood of viral transmission, including frequent hand washing, physical distancing, the use of face coverings and other personal protective equipment where necessary, and frequent surface disinfection, in both labs and common spaces.\nGiven the complexity and field-specific considerations of laboratory research, each laboratory has first developed a local plan that ensures safe operation and complies with the framework outlined in the Phase 2 guidelines. In addition, each department has developed a framework governing access to shared equipment and spaces and received approval from Dartmouth's Office of Environmental Health and Safety.\nWe will continue to monitor compliance with health screening and other requirements to assess our capacity for further progress during phase 2. The measures we are taking are designed not solely to prevent infections in the current environment, but also to make sure that any new outbreak will be unable to spread undetected in our research community. We will continue to track local case rates and disease outcomes. If we maintain our successful trajectory, we look forward to further incremental enhancements over the coming months. If case rates or outcomes worsen, more stringent restrictions may be re-imposed to protect community health and safety.\nEvent Limits - Extended, June 17, 2020\nOut of an abundance of caution, Dartmouth is extending its guidance to limit gatherings on campus. Until further notice, all events of 10 or more people should be canceled, postponed, streamed/made virtual, or otherwise modified to bring attendance to fewer than 10 people. This applies to all gatherings organized by Dartmouth or hosted on Dartmouth property.\nOrganizers of events and gatherings of fewer than 10 people should continue to ensure that there is adequate space (typically one-third of room capacity) to accommodate the event and participants.\nOut-of-State Quarantine for Those Returning to Campus and Visitors, June 11, 2020\nDartmouth's guidance on travel and quarantine requirements follows current guidance from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. See the latest New Hampshire guidance for employees and travel. (PDF)\nAccording to this guidance, anyone who has traveled internationally (including to Canada), traveled on public conveyances outside of New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine, or who has been on a cruise, should quarantine for 14 days when they return and before returning to campus. Public conveyances include, but are not limited to, airplanes, trains, subways, buses, boats, vans, ride-shares, or taxis used by the public, whether for compensation or not. Public conveyances do not include privately owned vehicles used for private purposes.\nThose who can self-quarantine and work remotely may do so. If you are traveling outside of New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine and are not using a public conveyance, no quarantine is required upon your return. If traveling, individuals should check and follow quarantine requirements in their final\ndestination as well. We recognize that travel recommendations and quarantine requirements vary by state, including between New Hampshire and Vermont. Everyone is expected to follow their state's quarantine requirements outside of their work hours.\nGiven the risk of transmission and restrictions on travel, and to protect everyone's health, visitors who have not received specific authorization to be at Dartmouth should not be coming to campus.\nPolicy: Face Covering Required During Coronavirus Pandemic, June 10, 2020\nDartmouth requires all persons to wear cloth face coverings at all times when using or accessing shared or communal spaces at any Dartmouth worksite and also when a minimum of six feet of physical distancing is difficult to maintain. This requirement is designed to help protect the health and safety of the Dartmouth community by reducing the risk of coronavirus transmission. Read the entire policy for further information.\nSelf-Quarantine for 14 Days, updated May 29, 2020\nUseful Definitions: Isolation and quarantine help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.\nIsolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.\nQuarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were potentially exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.\nDo not go to work or school during this 14-day period. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House). Dick's House will monitor all students who should be in self-quarantine or self-isolation.\nTake these steps to monitor your health and practice physical distancing:\nTake your temperature with a thermometer at least two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.\nWatch for other symptoms such as fever, respiratory illness (cough, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath), mild flu-like illness (fatigue, chills, muscle aches) and/or loss of taste or smell.\nStay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.\nDo not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.\nDo not have any visitors to your house during this time. If you must have visitors, tell them that you are under quarantine.\nFall International Programs Canceled, May 29, 2020\nBecause of significant continued risk to participants' health and safety and severe restrictions to travel and mobility, Dartmouth has made the decision to cancel all structured fall term international programs for undergraduate and graduate and professional students. This includes language study abroad, foreign study programs, fall exchange programs, and all Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships and fellowships. Other Dartmouth-supported graduate and professional school international travel programs and clinical electives are canceled through November. Domestic clinical rotations through Geisel will proceed as planned. The graduate and professional school deans will be in touch with their students to outline these changes and answer related questions. In June, the Tuck School will announce additional details about travel planning. Note that Dartmouth's policy restricting Dartmouth-sponsored domestic travel remains unchanged. Students are encouraged to consider remote/virtual leave-term opportunities until travel can resume.\nChanges to Undergraduate First-Year Trips, May 29, 2020\nDartmouth has announced that first-year trips will need to take a different form for the Class of 2024. Given existing public health uncertainties and restrictions, and the potential impact on emergency medical resources, we have decided that sending hundreds of students out on trips in August is not feasible this year. Although this decision is likely not a surprise to most, we know that it is still disappointing; however, it is a shift, and not a cancellation. Student trips directors have notified the '24s that they are committed to providing all first-year students with a shared trips experience this year and throughout their time at Dartmouth.\nEmployee Benefits Updates During Covid-18, April 8, 2020\nThe Office of Human Resources has new information on interim changes to medical and prescription benefits, health savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts a result of COVID-19.\nInformation on the Hiring Freeze, April 4, 2020\nThe Office of Human Resources has information on the COVID-19 hiring freeze. The HR site includes the process for requesting recruitment and review of a position thought to be of critical need. It also has an FAQ on the hiring freeze.\nSummer Off-Campus and Travel Update, March 30, 2020\nDartmouth has made the decision to suspend all undergraduate international programs for the full summer term and all domestic summer term programs scheduled for the months of June and July. This includes all summer term study-abroad undergraduate programs, including language study abroad (LSA), foreign study programs (FSP), and exchange programs; and Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships, research grants, and fellowships. Students who are pursuing leave-term opportunities that can be fulfilled remotely or with an alternative set-up from their current location and requiring no air travel may request an exemption from this policy. This decision does not apply to programs run by the graduate and professional schools, and students will be notified by their respective school regarding decisions about such programs.\nVermont/New Hampshire Stay-at-Home Update, March 27, 2020\nRecent emergency orders from N.H. Gov. Chris Sununu and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott restricting and minimizing activities outside of the home permit Dartmouth to continue its existing arrangements for core campus operations and remote teaching and working. The safety and wellbeing of our employees is our highest concern during this difficult time. Employees who have questions about their ability to work on campus should speak with their supervisor/manager about their concerns.\nEmpathy and Inclusion Update, March 24, 2020\nDuring this difficult time, it is important to practice empathy and inclusion. No one is at a higher health risk because of their racial, ethnic, cultural, or other identity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation about COVID-19 can spark fear and hostility that hurts people and makes it difficult to stay healthy. We are stronger as a community when we stand together against discrimination and share information that we know to be factual. See the CDC website for suggestions on combating social stigma during this health crisis.\nSpring Term Changes, Update, March 17, 2020\nWe have made the decision that all spring term classes, both undergraduate and graduate, will be conducted by remote learning for the full term. There will be no in-person option to attend classes on campus after May 1. This was a difficult decision that we know will be frustrating and disappointing for many of our students. Unfortunately, we are not alone. Across the country, many colleges and universities are taking similar steps in reducing the number of people on their campuses as a way to protect communities from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe recognize that many students will have questions related to this transition to a full remote learning term, including financial questions. A group of administrators is working on further guidance related to billing and financial aid issues and will be in touch on this topic soon.\nThroughout the 10-week term the Dartmouth campus will remain open, faculty and staff\u2060\u2014including union employees\u2014will be paid as usual, and graduate students will continue to receive their stipends.\nAt the recommendation of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Geisel School of Medicine has suspended all clinical rotations, effective today. This includes clerkships and electives.\nTuck School of Business Spring Term, March 18, 2020\nThe Tuck School of Business is moving all MBA courses to remote-only learning for the entire spring term, with no option for students to attend class in person. To the extent possible, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities will also be delivered remotely during this time.\nAthletics\nThe Ivy League presidents announced their unanimous decision to cancel all spring athletics competition and practices for the remainder of the academic year. In light of the pandemic, and the growing number of schools that have moved classes online for the rest of their semesters, it is no longer feasible for these competitions and practices to continue. This is a heavy blow to our student-athletes, who have sacrificed and trained so hard in their respective sports, and we regret the impact of these circumstances. The league also stated that winter teams and student-athletes who have qualified for postseason play will be able to participate in league competitions. However, the NCAA announced that all winter and spring championships have been canceled. Read the NCAA announcement.\nSocial Distancing\nSocial distancing, also known as physical distancing, means:\nRemaining away from settings where people are meeting\nTrying to stay home and only go out for essentials reasons like food and medicine\nAvoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet) from others when possible\nRemaining alert for respiratory symptoms (a cough or shortness of breath) and fever.\nPracticing strict respiratory etiquette and hygiene. This includes covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not available.\nSocial contact is more important than ever during this stressful time. Be sure to stay connected with friends and family using digital technologies such as FaceTime, Skype, or Zoom; letter-writing; and phone calls.\nIf you have been advised to self-observe for COVID-19 symptoms, please monitor your health according to New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services instructions, wear a cloth face covering when you leave your home, and practice physical distancing.\nIf you feel feverish or develop a cough or shortness of breath, please seek health advice. Before going to a doctor's office or emergency room call ahead and tell the provider or office about your recent travel and symptoms. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House). Dick's House will monitor all students who should be in self-quarantine or self-isolation.\nTeach Remotely\nGuidelines for faculty on how to teach from anywhere can be found on Dartmouth's Teach Remotely website.\nCDC Guidance to Higher Risk Individuals\nGuidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is encouraging older people (60 years of age or more) and those with chronic\nconditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease to stay at home as much as possible. Early data suggests that older people are twice as likely to develop serious illness from the novel coronavirus. Individuals in these two groups should consider avoiding activities such as traveling by airplane, going to movie theaters, shopping in crowded areas, and attending religious services.\nFor more information, visit the CDC website.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/important-updates"},

{"title": "Community Conversations: An Updated Budget Picture", "text": "Watch the July 22 Community Conversation webcast with Provost Joseph Helble, COVID-19 task force co-chairs Lisa Adams and Josh Keniston, and Chief Financial Officer Michael Wagner.\nDartmouth's budget shortfall for fiscal year 2020 was substantially less than initially projected, closing with a $36 million loss rather than the $50 million gap that institutional leaders had projected in March, Provost Joseph Helble said during Wednesday's Community Conversations webcast, a live discussion about Dartmouth's operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCalling the deficit \"still substantial, but one-third less than we had projected when we first met,\" Helble said that philanthropy, better-than-expected performance of the financial markets, and steps the community took to reduce non-compensation expenses had made a tremendous difference.\nSpeaking from the Starr Studio in Dartmouth Library's Baker-Berry Library, Helble said that because of all these factors, \"We were able to bring fiscal year '20 to a successful close.\"\nThe picture for the 2021 fiscal year, which began July 1, also looks much better than it did, Helble said. Initial projections showed a potential $100 million shortfall for a budget of about $1.1 billion, but salary and hiring freezes, the recently announced early-retirement program, further non-compensation spending reductions, and use of a revenue stabilization reserve fund established by President Philip J. Hanlon '77 early in his tenure have come close to balancing the budget.\nTo close the gap further, Helble said that division leaders this week received revised budget targets for the year, and in the coming weeks there will be opportunities \"to engage individuals from all divisions across campus in some creative cross-institutional thinking to seek more efficient ways to accomplish our work.\"\nThat said, Dartmouth will not extend its commitment to pay all salaries beyond the previously announced date of July 31. Helble acknowledged that some jobs may be cut on a division-by-division basis\u2014although leaving vacancies unfilled, the early-retirement program, and other efforts will help mitigate the need for such measures.\n\"It will not be widespread, it will not be pan-institutional,\" he said of potential layoffs. \"I understand that these next steps create some anxiety, but our intention in trying to provide targets that are achievable significantly through means other than through compensation will reduce the impact and the number of any employment adjustments that need to be made.\" Further details will be announced within the next month, he said.\nJoining Helble via Zoom from his office in Parkhurst, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President for Finance Michael Wagner said that most of the shortfall from the fourth quarter of the past fiscal year came from the loss of about $15 million in expected room and board revenue during the spring term.\nBut the year ended better than anticipated thanks to cooperative financial markets and the work of the Dartmouth College Fund. \"The volunteers and the Advancement staff really worked miracles in terms of bringing that in close to expectation for the full year,\" Wagner said.\nHe said that in the coming year, Dartmouth expects to spend approximately $15 million in expenses related to COVID-19, including testing, personal protective equipment, classroom technology, and health management tools.\nAsked how other colleges and universities facing COVID-19 related shortfalls are approaching the challenge, Wagner noted that while many of Dartmouth's strategies are similar to its peers, unlike many other institutions, Dartmouth has no plans to cut employee retirement contributions for the current fiscal year.\nOn this point, Helble said he was \"pleased with the way different groups in the community came together to weigh in\" against that option. \"It was an extraordinary demonstration of the Dartmouth community.\"\nHelble was also joined by COVID-19 task force co-chairs Lisa Adams, associate dean for global health and an associate professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine, and Josh Keniston, vice president for institutional projects, who spoke from their homes. Helble and his guests took questions from viewers in a conversation moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to the studio.\nAsked about the recent surge of COVID-19 cases nationally, Adams said, \"This is what exponential growth of an epidemic looks like, and it's always harder to play catch-up once spread starts.\" She said that Dartmouth is monitoring the numbers closely and is prepared if need be to shift its plans for the coming term to protect the health and safety of the community.\n\"One concrete example I can give of how this national data has affected our planning is we are now carefully exploring options for pre-arrival testing of undergraduate students\" in addition to the testing students will need to do when they get to Hanover, Adams said.\nShe also spoke about the plans to institute 14-day quarantines for arriving students. A newly formed student advisory group consisting of a dozen students from the classes of 2021, 2022, and 2023 will be giving input on how to make that a manageable experience for those in residence during fall term.\nKeniston spoke about the challenge of reconfiguring building spaces to conform with rapidly changing health requirements. In many Dartmouth facilities \"the systems and processes we have in place have been developed over decades,\" he said. \"Now we are having to reinvent them in a matter of weeks.\"\nKeniston also spoke about progress toward returning student belongings left on campus at the end of winter term. \"We are making good progress and really driving toward having this wrapped up by the middle of August,\" he said.\nAmong other topics discussed in Wednesday's episode:\nStudents will be informed July 31 which terms they can be in residence. All members of the Class of 2024 and the Class of 2022 and all new transfer students who requested to be on campus in the fall term can be accommodated, as can all students who requested the winter term as their first choice.\nThere will be no winter undergraduate off-campus programs.\nThe phased reopening of the libraries has been successful to date, with more than 200 visitors to Baker-Berry Library in the first two weeks and several in-person research appointments completed or scheduled at Rauner Special Collections Library. Details on the next phases of library and laboratory reopening will be provided over the coming month.\nCommunity Conversations is an online forum for Dartmouth community members to ask questions and learn from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the pandemic. The live discussions, produced by Dartmouth's Media Production Group and the Office of Communications, air on selected Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. The next webcast is set for Aug. 5.\nPast episodes are available on the Community Conversations site, which includes call-in numbers for those who want to listen to the show without video.

{"title": "Policy: Face Covering Required", "text": "Policy: Face Covering Required During COVID-19 Pandemic, June 10, 2020\nAlso see: Face-Covering Policy Frequently Asked Questions\nApplies to: All persons, including but not limited to, all employees (faculty, staff, researchers, trainees, post-docs, visiting scholars, student employees), third-party business entities, visitors, and students, authorized to enter any Dartmouth worksite (\"all persons\"). Nothing in this policy authorizes a return to on-site work by any person or creates or expands rights of access. Policies on these issues are stated in other Dartmouth COVID-19 policies.\nPurpose: To protect the health and safety of the Dartmouth community by reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\nPolicy Statement: Dartmouth requires all persons to wear cloth face coverings at all times when using or accessing shared or communal spaces at any Dartmouth worksite and also when a minimum of six feet of physical distancing is difficult to maintain.\nSix feet of physical distancing, often referred to as social distancing, remains important in slowing the spread of the COVID-19. Even when physical distancing can be maintained, a cloth face covering is required as an additional public health measure to help prevent the spread of the virus from a person who may be carrying the virus but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering is not considered personal protective equipment (PPE) and does not protect the wearer from the COVID-19 virus. Employees whose jobs require the use of PPE will be provided with appropriate face masks to meet PPE standards applicable to their positions.\nCloth face coverings are just one protective measure, and are not a substitute for physical distancing, regular hand washing and hand sanitizing, and additional cleaning protocols.\nExamples of when cloth face coverings are required include:\nWhen entering or exiting buildings\nWhen traveling in a vehicle with another person on Dartmouth business\nWhen using or traveling through any common areas and shared spaces in buildings, even if another person is not immediately visible or present in the space at that time: Restrooms Kitchens and kitchenettes Break rooms Elevators Conference rooms Libraries Hallways and corridors Shared workspaces and offices Private offices when more than one person is present Classrooms Laboratories where more than one person may be present, including access to: Core facilities Shared equipment rooms Laboratory space assigned to or shared with other research groups Enclosed single laboratories, if more than one person is scheduled to be present\nEmployees are not required to wear face coverings:\nWhen working in a private and enclosed office or laboratory space that is not shared with any other individual.\nWhen eating or drinking in a common dining area or break room that has been designated and approved for employee breaks with physical distancing protocols marked and observed.\nProcedures: Cloth face coverings must securely cover one's nose and mouth, should not be reversed, moved or removed unnecessarily, should not be shared with others, and must be kept clean. Single-use face coverings must be properly and safely discarded after each use. Face covering or N95 mask with one-way exhalation valves are not acceptable as they are designed to allow droplets to pass through the covering. Cloth face coverings may be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost. They may also be purchased from multiple locations. Dartmouth will provide cloth face coverings for anyone in need; employees should let their supervisor know if they need to be provided with a face covering.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, an effective cloth covering will:\nFit snugly but comfortably against the sides of the face\nBe secured with ties or ear loops\nInclude multiple layers of fabric\nAllow for breathing without restriction\nBe able to be laundered and machine-dried without damage or change to shape\nEnforcement: All persons accessing Dartmouth facilities or worksites are expected to comply with this policy, without exception. Anyone not wearing a face covering as expected will be asked to leave the facility immediately; will be subject to corrective action or disciplinary process as appropriate for failure to comply with Dartmouth policy; and may lose any privileges or ability to access Dartmouth facilities.\nInquiries regarding this policy should be directed to the Office of Human Resources. Reports of any violations of this policy may be made to an administrator in the facility or building, an employee's supervising department or division's administrative office, or to the Office of Human Resources. Employees who have concerns about adhering to this policy for medical reasons are encouraged to contact the ADA Coordinator in the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity to discuss possible accommodations.\nDuration: This policy will be in effect until further notice.\nResources: How to Safely Wear and Remove a Cloth Face Covering (CDC) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Recommendations", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/workplace-policies-and-resources/policy-face-covering-required"},

So, they've had to start their research remotely, visiting websites and using social media.\nIn this episode, \"Junior Jitters,\" Lee Coffin, vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, talks with three rising seniors from the Academy of the Pacific Rim, an unusual charter school in Hyde Park, Mass. Many of its graduates are the first in their families to attend college. Daysia Charles, Deric Fernandez, and Delia Howley have been trying to make the most of their stay-at-home summer. But Fernandez, who plans to study medicine, worries that his inability to work at a hospital this summer, as he had planned before COVID-19 hit, will weaken his application to colleges.\nNot so, says Coffin. \"If the internship can't happen this summer, or your mother has worries about having you spend time in a Boston hospital during this moment, the other way you can tell a college about that is just to reflect in your essay about what's pulling you toward medicine,\" he suggests. \"Approach it a little bit more philosophically.\"\nWhen talk turns to standardized tests, Coffin assures the students that colleges will be flexible, and that many, including Dartmouth, have decided to make the submission of scores optional this year, recognizing that exam sites may not be easily accessible to all applicants.\nAnd what keeps these students moving ahead, despite formidable obstacles? The episode ends with deeply inspiring answers to that question.\n\"The Search\" is now available on SoundCloud and the Department of Admissions website, and will also be available on Spotify, Apple Music, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, Pandora, RadioPublic, iHeart Radio, and Google Podcast.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/07/episode-eight-podcast-search-junior-jitters"},
{"title": "Dartmouth Announces Plans for the Coming Academic Year", "text": "Dartmouth today announced its plan to bring approximately half of the undergraduate student body back to campus for each term of the 2020-21 academic year. The graduate and professional schools have set related plans for their operation.\nAll plans emphasize the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff and include testing for the COVID-19 virus, remote learning for many on-campus students, and plans to evaluate and modify operations each term if virus conditions change.\n\"The absence of students, faculty, and staff enlivening the Hanover Plain makes us eager to be together again on campus, pursuing our mission of teaching, scholarship, and research,\" wrote President Philip J. Hanlon '77 and Provost Joseph J. Helble in an email sent this afternoon to all students, faculty, and staff. Messages about the coming year were also sent to incoming members of the Class of 2024 and their parents and to the parents of all undergraduates.\n\"The reality of COVID-19 means that the campus environment will be very different this fall,\" Hanlon and Helble wrote. \"As we plan for the return of faculty, students, and staff to campus, the health and safety of our community is our top priority.\"\n(The entire message can be found on the COVID-19 website, along with a list of frequently asked questions.)\nThe fall term will begin on Sept. 14 and students coming to campus will be required to quarantine for 14 days after arrival. There will be mandatory virus testing for all students upon their return to campus, with regular testing continuing throughout the term. Students who don't wish to participate in testing and other required health protocols can choose to enroll in remote learning off-campus.\nAll undergraduates will have single rooms or live in two-room doubles, which will reduce the overall space available in residence halls. Several halls are being set aside as quarantine locations to house students who test positive for the virus. Physical distancing requirements will also reduce the amount of classroom space available to faculty and students, requiring the majority of classes to be conducted remotely.\nStudents will have the opportunity to be on campus for two terms, with each class having one term in which they will have priority. Students will then rank their preferences for a second on-campus term. Incoming first-year students will have priority for fall term and for spring term. Details on residency and other information for new and returning undergraduates will be communicated to students by Dean of the College Kathryn Lively.\nUnderpinning the plan to return students to campus is the requirement that all members of the community comply with behavioral protocols and conditions in campus buildings and common spaces, including wearing face coverings in all but private spaces, maintaining physical distances, and avoiding large gatherings. Students who fail to comply will lose the privilege of being on campus.\n\"We join those who want to return to the important work and profound educational experiences provided by a fully residential year at Dartmouth, and we look forward to a time when that is possible. In the meantime, we have created a plan that adapts to the realities we face,\" wrote Hanlon and Helble. \"As difficult as it is to make these adjustments to our lives and learning, they are important measures to safeguard the health of our community while continuing to preserve our students' academic experience.\"\nOther changes included in the plan for the coming academic year:\nAll undergraduates on campus will leave as soon as fall classes are over and take final exams remotely the week after Thanksgiving.\nMajor changes are not expected in graduate and professional student housing as existing on-campus housing already provides single bedrooms. Many graduate and professional students live off campus.\nIn addition to most undergraduate classes being held remotely, most faculty office hours will also be held remotely.\nAll community members living and working on campus will be required to participate in daily health screening using a phone application or communicating on a website.\nDartmouth Library will be open only to faculty, students, and staff.\nEnhanced cleaning procedures will be used in all campus buildings, some workspaces will be reconfigured, and work schedules may be changed to safeguard the health of employees.\nA decision on whether there will be fall season athletic competition rests with the Ivy League. A league announcement is expected next month.\nFor the latest information on Dartmouth's response to the pandemic visit the COVID-19 website.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/06/dartmouth-announces-plans-coming-academic-year"},

The guidance directs the students to transfer to a school offering in-person courses or leave the United States.\n\"We remain firm in our belief that Dartmouth can realize its full potential only if it welcomes the most talented students, faculty, and scholars, regardless of their nation of origin. Any action inhibiting the free exchange of talent and ideas limits our ability to advance Dartmouth's core academic mission,\" Dartmouth says in a statement released today.\n\"By restricting international students' participation in any online courses our faculty choose to offer to protect the health and safety of our community members in the face of the continuing pandemic, the SEVP guidance strikes at the heart of that mission,\" the statement says.\n\"For that reason, we will stand with our peers in opposing this guidance, through an amicus brief supporting today's federal lawsuit filed by Harvard and MIT seeking a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the guidance, through the national associations advocating for higher education institutions and our international students, and through continued outreach to our elected representatives.\"\nDartmouth is working to identify possible solutions for fall-term instruction and housing and will provide resources to the institution's international students.\nThe new rule shifts federal guidance that was in place for the spring and summer terms, which, as Inside Higher Ed explains, \"allowed international students residing in the U.S. to take a fully online course load as colleges transitioned to online instruction in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\"\nThe website reported that more than 90% of international students remained in the U.S. in the spring.\nSusan Boutwell can be reached at susan.j.boutwell@dartmouth.edu.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/07/dartmouth-joins-opposition-international-student-rules"},

Resources are also available at Wellness at Dartmouth.\nWill faculty tenure and promotion considerations continue?\nDartmouth has enacted an institution-wide one-year extension to the tenure clock for all current tenure-track faculty members, except for those whose portfolios are complete and whose reviews are anticipated to be completed during the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year. The extension, which applies to faculty at any stage of the tenure-track process with the exception noted above, is supported by the deans of all our schools, and applies to all tenure-track faculty in Arts and Sciences, Geisel, Thayer, and Tuck. The extension allows for flexibility for all faculty whose work will be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions on travel and operations. However, no faculty member is required to utilize the extension. Those who wish to remain on their current timeline may choose to do so and should consult their chair, associate dean, or dean at the appropriate time.\nWhat precautions are in place for employees who continue to work on campus?\nOur environmental health and safety team is providing guidance for those who do need to be on-campus about best practices to protect themselves and recommending appropriate protective equipment. Faculty who are returning to campus to work are required to complete the Temperature Screening Assessment prior to coming on-site.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/faculty-frequently-asked-questions"},
{"title": "Students: Frequently Asked Questions", "text": "Students Frequently Asked Questions\nStudent Belongings\nResidential Life\nCourses, Enrollment, D-Plan, Special Circumstances\nTuition, Financial Aid, and Employment\nAccessibility\nSeniors and Graduation\nStudent Belongings\nWhen will students who left belongings on campus receive them? How will students know when those have been shipped?\nWe are committed to completing the process for graduating students by mid-June, and for all undergraduates by August 15. If a student chooses a shipping option on their undergraduate housing questionnaire, we will email them when their items have been shipped.\nHow will this process work for graduating students?\nWe will pack and ship items first for students who are graduating. Unless the student indicates otherwise on the undergraduate housing questionnaire, we will begin packing graduating students' belongings next week, following all physical distancing and other public health requirements. We expect to begin shipping items before the end of May, and to complete shipping to graduating students by mid-June. Large items will be stored here in controlled storage until it is possible for students to return to pick them up. We will hold large items in storage for up to a year to give graduates adequate time to arrange to retrieve them.\nWill Dartmouth cover the costs of shipping and storing student items?\nYes, the College will pay for returning and storing student items during this process.\nHow will the College work with international students to return their items?\nAt this time, international shipping presents a variety of challenges. Packing and storing those items may be the best and safest option for the time being. We will work individually with international students on the best and logistically feasible options.\nWhat are the shipping restrictions on large items?\nAnything flammable/hazardous/illegal, appliances/electronics, bicycles, carpets/rugs, dirty dishes/plates/utensils, exercise equipment, food and drink, furniture, mattresses, large paintings/artwork/signs, plants, refrigerators, televisions, and similar items cannot be shipped.\nWhat about the belongings of students in living-learning communities and Greek organization facilities?\nOur process includes all College-owned residential facilities for undergraduates. The director of Greek life will work with the leadership of organizations that operate privately-owned Greek facilities on a process for belongings left in those buildings.\nWhere are you storing things that students would like to leave on campus?\nWe expect that all items will be stored in controlled storage locations on campus. In the unlikely event that we need overflow, items will be placed in secure local storage at the College's expense.\nWhat if a student's item gets lost or damaged?\nReimbursement requests for damage to personal property prior to shipping will be handled through the normal Dartmouth reimbursement process.\nWhy can't students watch via FaceTime or some other platform as their belongings are packed?\nTo be as efficient as possible, we hope to sort out concerns about individual belongings before packing begins, using the student's shipping form and following up with students if we need clarification.\nWhen will students know if they can sign up for the controlled/timed on-campus return process this summer? What will that look like?\nFirst and foremost, this will depend on the evolving public health situation. We expect to be in touch with students by mid- to late-June with an update for this option. The process will likely permit no more than one or two people (including a designated proxy if a student is unable to return), to come to campus during a designated two-hour time slot in July to collect their items. We will share details as we receive students' preferences, and process information. Again, all packing, storage, and shipping must be completed no later than August 15 so that we can clean and prepare the residence halls for possible occupancy in the fall.\nCan students access packages previously delivered to their Hinman address?\nHinman has approximately 300 packages that arrived before spring break. We will store the packages until a student's return, or ship them by the end of spring term to the address the student has provided on the belongings form.\nHow should students retrieve their cars?\nAll students will be able to retrieve cars as part of the return pick-up process that we hope to be able to offer in July (see above). Or, they can pick up their car when they return to enroll in classes.\nRESIDENTIAL LIFE\nAre some students still on campus? If so, how many, and why are they still living on campus?\nFor a variety of reasons, about 300 students received approval to stay in residence halls for spring term. Approximately 169 students still remain. Following public health guidance, the students are required to avoid groups and social gatherings, and practice social distancing. They are also not allowed to let anyone else into their residence halls for any reason.\nFor the students remaining on campus, what facilities will be open and when? What facilities are closed?\nThere are limited facilities open on campus. The gym, library, Collis Center, and Robinson Hall are closed. Dartmouth Dining is preparing takeout meals only for those undergraduates approved to live in residence halls during spring term. Dartmouth is unable to offer meals for students, faculty, and staff living off-campus. Food to go is available at the Class of 1953 Commons daily during these times:\nBreakfast: 9 to 10:30 a.m.\nLunch: 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nDinner: 4 to 6 p.m.\nAccess to meal pick-up at '53 Commons is limited to 10 campus residents at a time. The building will close for cleaning between each meal period. All diners should wash their hands before entering the building. All other dining locations will remain closed for spring term.\nWhat should I do if I'm on campus and think I have COVID-19 symptoms?\nDick's House providers continue to be available if you have any health concerns. If you need to consult with one of our primary care clinicians, call Dick's House at 603-646-9400.\nWhat if I or a family member get sick with COVID-19 and I am unable to take classes this spring?\nWe are trying to provide as much flexibility as possible through the design of the remote courses to help students maintain academic progress. Existing withdrawal policies remain available for those students who need them, in consultation with their undergraduate dean and other campus resources.\nCOURSES, ENROLLMENT, D-PLAN, SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nWhy did Dartmouth move to online learning for summer term?\nA residential summer term relying on physical distancing and severe restrictions on activities and gatherings would pose a significant public health risk to our students and to our faculty and staff, their families, and the Upper Valley community. Put simply, given the continuing progression of the disease, a wide geographic disparity in its containment, the continuing lack of adequate testing capability, and no widespread effective treatment, with the health and safety of our community being of paramount importance we cannot offer a residential summer term. As a result, all graduate and undergraduate classes will be conducted remotely.\nHow can I get technology help?\nYou can request support on the Dartmouth Services portal.\nHow will undergraduates be graded for spring term?\nWe are implementing a credit/no credit (CT/NC) grading system for all undergraduate courses during spring term 2020. All undergraduate student work will continue to be rigorously assessed and evaluated, and academic citations will still be awarded for exceptional work according to existing guidelines. Spring term courses may be used for general education requirements and can be applied toward a student's major but will not be factored into grade point averages; median grades will not be reported for spring term. While some students may thrive in this distance-learning scenario, we decided that uniform grading, for this term only, was the fairest way to support all of our undergraduate students, and would give our faculty time to focus on the content of their coursework while also providing the opportunity to develop assessments that can be used if remote learning continues into summer term. The CT/NC grading system will apply to undergraduate courses only; graduate and professional schools and programs will be using their typical grading systems unless they notify students otherwise.\nWill interactive components of certain courses, including labs, drill, music/studio, and art/theatre, be adjusted to the online setting?\nA final list of available courses will be posted on March 23. Faculty are working hard and getting creative to find ways to move as many courses to a remote format, however some are more difficult than others and not all may be available.\nCan first-year students, sophomores, and juniors elect to take spring term as an off-term? If so, can summer term be available to all students who wish to attend?\nSpring off-terms are an option, however there are considerations that need to be taken into account when changing your D-plan. For example, completion of the first-year writing and seminar requirements are a prerequisite for off-campus study and there are minimum credit thresholds that student-athletes must meet each year in order to be eligible for the following year.\nAre sophomores still required to take a sophomore summer term?\nSophomores traditionally take classes on campus in what's called \"sophomore summer.\" There is still an expectation that students will engage in a single summer residential term as part of the requirements for graduation. Each student should be in touch with the registrar's office to discuss any changes requested to the plan that the student currently has in place.\nHow will the course adjustment period work for spring term? Will the add/drop processes, shopping period, and withdrawal policy remain the same?\nAt this time, there are no known changes in the existing processes.\nHow will online classes work for students in different time zones?\nThere will be a variety of course types based on the needs of specific courses and faculty.\nWhat technological platforms will the College be using for remote instruction? Will these platforms be provided to students free of charge?\nFaculty will primarily use platforms that we already have on campus such as Zoom and Canvas that do not require an additional fee from students.\nIs the College planning to make adjustments to summer term?\nDartmouth has made the decision to suspend all undergraduate international programs for the full summer term and all domestic summer term programs scheduled for the months of June and July. This includes all summer term study-abroad undergraduate programs, including language study abroad (LSA), foreign study programs (FSP), and exchange programs; and Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships, research grants, and fellowships. Students who are pursuing leave-term opportunities that can be fulfilled remotely or with an alternative set-up from their current location and requiring no air travel may request an exemption from this policy. This decision does not apply to programs run by the graduate and professional schools, and students will be notified by their respective school regarding decisions about such programs.\nHow will undergraduates be graded for summer term?\nOn May 18 the Faculty of Arts and Sciences department and program chairs voted in favor of offering an expanded non-recording option for summer term 2020 only. Details on the NRO change are available on the Office of the Registrar website.\nWill research be suspended or terminated?\nAs have many of our peer institutions, Dartmouth has ramped-down and paused on-campus research activities. Our goal is to minimize in-person contacts to limit the opportunities for the spread of the novel coronavirus, including interactions among our researchers, support staff, and the public. This is not a decision to cease research or scholarship. However, beginning on March 23, research staff and students must perform their scholarly work remotely, unless an extension for on-campus work has been granted to use a laboratory. We will be working with all members of the academic and funding communities to minimize the negative impact on faculty, staff, and students.\nHow should graduate students handle thesis and dissertation work?\nStudents should arrange to have private and public defenses remotely for all participants. Electronic signatures will be accepted on the thesis title page.\nHow will the 2020 fall term be structured?\nDartmouth intends to bring some number of undergraduates back to live and study on campus this fall\u2014the largest number we feel can be accommodated while minimizing risk for students, faculty, staff, and our neighbors in the Upper Valley. In the most likely scenario, we expect to have a mix of in-person and virtual classes in the fall for both undergraduates and graduate and professional students. We will also need to modify the ways in which students live to achieve less density in our residence and dining halls and maintain capacity for students who fall ill or need to self-quarantine.\nThe COVID-19 Task Force is working to address other operational matters related to our gradual return, such as whether off-campus programs can run this fall, what facilities we will designate for quarantine and isolation space, and a host of other issues. As has been our process since the start of this pandemic, recommendations from the task force will be presented to senior administrators for consideration, taking into account the latest data on the spread of the virus. Our goal is to communicate final decisions on fall term operations by June 29.\nTUITION, FINANCIAL AID, AND EMPLOYMENT\nWhat will happen to students who have work expectations in their financial aid package and depend on the income?\nEmployment during this period of remote instruction has been challenging for many students. On March 16, the College took steps to allow enrolled students the opportunity to work remotely for the duration of this public health emergency. Students who could continue their work remotely were encouraged and re-hired to do so and employers were encouraged to evaluate tasks that could be completed remotely and hire student employees if appropriate.\nWhile these measures have resulted in the employment of many, there are still a number of students with work expectations in their financial aid package for spring term who are either unemployed or underemployed. We recognize that many of these students rely on this work income for essential needs and we have devised measures to assist students during this crisis by providing potential supplemental aid when unemployed or underemployed. Please visit the Student Employment Office for details.\nDo students have to pay full tuition for summer term? What about room and board?\nDartmouth's teaching is a point of pride and distinction. For summer term, our commitment to excellent instruction will be no different, even with the delivery being different. Our faculty have quickly and enthusiastically embraced the challenge of planning for virtual instruction for the summer term. We will charge regular tuition for summer term, as are our peers, and we will strengthen financial aid to meet the increased need we know many students and their families are feeling as a result of the disruption from the pandemic. We will not charge room and board for summer term.\nHow will refunds for housing and meal plans be disbursed? Does this differ for students receiving financial aid?\nStudent bills are being updated to reflect appropriate room and board status and to reflect updated financial aid.\nHow will students who bear the extra cost of living off-campus be supported, given that campus amenities, services and jobs are no longer available to them?\nWe are updating our financial aid packages to reflect these changing needs.\nACCESSIBILITY\nHow will students without a reliable internet connection or printers be accommodated?\nOur team is working to provide internet access to students who do not have it. We will provide an update next week.\nWill the faculty use materials that can be procured online, and will textbooks/books required for courses be available for free?\nThe library staff are working with faculty to make as many resources available online as possible.\nHow will student accommodations offered through Student Accessibility Services (SAS) be ensured and respected in an online setting?\nThe SAS director is part of the academic continuity planning team working to transition courses to a remote format. Resources will be available to support approved accommodations in this context.\nSENIORS AND GRADUATION\nWhat are the plans for commencement for the Class of 2020?\nDartmouth will hold a virtual degree-conferring ceremony called Celebrating the Moment: Dartmouth 2020 on June 14. Event details can be found on the commencement website. In addition, the 2020 graduates will be invited to return to campus in June of 2021 for a special commencement celebration. A date and details about the 2021 event are currently under discussion.\nWill graduating students have to pass the swim test or meet outstanding physical education requirements?\nWe have suspended the requirements of a successful swim test and all remaining physical education credits for those undergraduate students who are graduating through summer term 2020 and have not yet met these requirements.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/students-frequently-asked-questions"},
{"title": "Community Conversations: Preparing for the Academic Year", "text": "Watch the June 24 Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and guests Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health CEO Joanne Conroy '77 and Neal Katyal '91, former acting solicitor general of the United States.\nAll undergraduates will have the opportunity to study on campus over the course of the 2020-2021 academic year\u2014though not all at the same time, Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday during the weekly Community Conversations webcast, a live video broadcast about Dartmouth's operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Our goal is to offer two residential terms for every returning student who can and who chooses to be on campus this upcoming academic year,\" Helble said.\nThe full plan, which will be released in an email to the community on Monday, June 29, will cover fall 2020 through summer 2021, and will reflect a mix of residential and remote learning.\n\"From the outset, President Hanlon and I have stressed our goal of supporting the maximum number of students we can return to campus, guided first and foremost by the application of appropriate public health standards,\" said Helble, who spoke as usual from the Starr Studio in Dartmouth Library's Berry Library.\n\"Community health\u2014our students, our faculty, our staff, and the broader Upper Valley community\u2014is at the forefront of our minds in our decision-making.\"\nWhile aspects of the plan are still being finalized, Helble revealed some key details. For example, returning students will be asked to agree to be tested for COVID-19 when they arrive on campus and as directed throughout the term. And everyone on campus will be expected to comply with Dartmouth's mask-wearing and social-distancing policies and to participate in Dartmouth's contact-tracing program, which Helble said he expects will include both in-person and digital components.\nIn determining which students will be on campus when, priority will be given to keeping the incoming Class of 2024 together as a cohort, and to maintaining a low-density population in residence halls so that each student can live in their own room, with space on campus for quarantined students as needed.\n\"We anticipate that beyond the first-year class, other students will be able to express some preference in determining which terms work best with their academic plan of study,\" Helble said.\nThat said, Helble acknowledged that \"fall will be different from a typical term for residential students here and elsewhere.\" Among the differences: Social gatherings will be limited, and \"much of our teaching may well be done via remote learning, even for those physically present in Hanover.\"\nDartmouth is partnering with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) to implement testing and monitoring systems for students, faculty, and staff. Joining Helble via Zoom from DHMC in Lebanon, N.H., Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health President and CEO Joanne Conroy '77 said the medical center currently has the capacity to complete 1,000 COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab tests a day, and expects to increase that to 1,500 soon.\n\"You get results overnight, so it's actually quite fast,\" Conroy said. \"And for the majority of the students that come back on campus, and faculty, there's a way to really create a cadence for testing so people get their results very quickly.\"\nDHMC researchers are also exploring new methods of testing and community monitoring\u2014including wastewater testing\u2014and Conroy hopes some of these will be ready to be applied to the Dartmouth community by September.\nConroy held up as reason for hope the Upper Valley community's substantial success in containing the virus since DHMC identified the first confirmed case in New England on Feb. 28. The current rate of positive COVID-19 tests in all of DHMC's testing in the community is 2.5%\u2014\"very, very low,\" Conroy said.\n\"What that first patient did is activate the entire Upper Valley,\" she said. \"The Upper Valley community has been a great partner. They have taken this to heart\u2014they self-quarantine if they are ill, they stay at home, they wear masks, they obey all the rules to stay healthy.\"\nAt the medical center itself, mask and face-screen policies, coupled with aggressive contact tracing, testing, and quarantine protocols have to date helped prevent a wider outbreak, Conroy said.\nTo discuss some of the tradeoffs in privacy Dartmouth is asking students to make in exchange for an in-person educational experience, Helble was joined by Neal Katyal '91, former acting solicitor general of the United States and parent of a Dartmouth student. Katyal, who is the Paul and Patricia Saunders Professor of National Security Law at Georgetown University Law Center, spoke from his home near Washington, D.C.\nHe said issues of privacy are often posed against issues of safety and security, \"but often you have privacy or liberty on both sides of the equation, and I think coronavirus is a really good example of that. Because if we don't restrict our students' liberties in some way, we just can't open at all as a college. And that's a far greater intrusion of liberty and imposition on them.\"\nKatyal said he's been impressed with Dartmouth's response to the pandemic. \"I've never been prouder to be a Dartmouth alum than now. From start to finish the way that the College has handled coronavirus has been inspiring,\" he said.\nHelble, Conroy, and Katyal took questions from viewers in a conversation moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to the studio.\nAmong other topics discussed on Wednesday's episode:\nPlans to continue expanding access to research facilities, which are currently in the fourth week of a phased reopening. Helble said that phase two, which will permit more than one person in a lab at a given time, will likely begin in early July.\nA phased reopening of Dartmouth libraries is currently being planned for mid-July.\n\"Let me say to the full community, not only do I appreciate your patience as we work through these difficult questions, but your continuing dedication to the learning of our students and the research and scholarship that's conducted here on this campus to support the advancement of knowledge in society is truly inspiring,\" Helble said.\nCommunity Conversations is produced by Dartmouth's Media Production Group and the Office of Communications. The show airs Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m., and is scheduled to continue through July. The next episode is set for July 8. Schedules and past episodes are available on the Community Conversations site, which includes call-in numbers for those who want to listen to the show without video.

{"title": "February 2, 2020 Update", "text": "February 2, 2020\nTo the Dartmouth community,\nAs the situation related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, first identified in Wuhan, China, in December, continues to develop, we remain in close contact with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) and are closely monitoring advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We have received a new health advisory from NHDHHS and would like to remind you of what we already know and update you with the most current guidance for members of the Dartmouth community.\nLate last week, the U.S. Department of State elevated its China travel advisory to Level 4: Do Not Travel and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has declared a public health emergency. There are also restrictions beginning today for individuals who have recently been in China, including a temporary ban on entry into the United States for foreign nationals who have been to mainland China in the last 14 days (other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents).\nConsistent with the most recent NHDHHS health advisory, Dartmouth community members should take the following steps:\nAll individuals who have traveled to locations in China within the last 14 days, even those without symptoms, should \"self-isolate\" for a period of 14 days from their last day of travel to China, and monitor themselves for fever and respiratory illness (such as cough or shortness of breath). \"Self-isolation\" includes avoiding public settings and any further travel. If travelers do develop fever or respiratory illness within 14 days of their departure from China, they should contact the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services at 603-271-4496.\nAll individuals who have traveled to locations in Hubei Province, China, within the last 14 days, even if they are without symptoms, should self-isolate as noted above AND contact the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services at 603-271-4496 for more active monitoring by state public health officials.\nNHDHHS has recommended that all health care clinic receptions and providers screen patients presenting with a fever or respiratory illness to find out whether the patient has traveled to anywhere in China. They will also screen patients for known close contact with a person confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection in the 14 days before their symptoms started. This screening has been in place at Dartmouth College Health Service/Dick's House and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center for the past week.\nDartmouth fully supports the guidance received from NHDHHS, and encourages people who have recently returned from China and are self-isolating to be in contact with their supervisors to arrange to be able to work remotely during this period.\nWe will continue to publish the latest information on the Dartmouth Health Service website (https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/).\nDuring this difficult time, it is important to remember that no one is at fault for spreading or contracting the coronavirus. Our community will maintain our commitment to treating and caring for affected individuals with dignity and respect. I want to reiterate that the risk of contracting this virus remains very low.\nRegards,\nMark Reed, MD\nDirector, Dartmouth College Health Service\nFor more information:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nNew Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/community-messages/february-2-2020-update"},

Domestic programs will continue as planned, including clinical rotations.\nDartmouth continues to discourage all international travel for students, faculty, and staff, including conference attendance and research site visitation. For complete guidance on travel restrictions and required self-quarantine, please visit dartmouth.edu/covid19.\nThis decision, which was made by the provost based on an analysis and recommendation from the Dartmouth COVID-19 Task Force, reflects a number of factors, including increasing travel uncertainty, risks to community health, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Service (NHDHHS), and concern for homestay families with vulnerable members in the home.\nUndergraduate students in credit-bearing programs affected by these cancellations will be able to access a $5,000 cash grant that can be used for independent research, internships, alternative education opportunities, or alternative off-campus housing for the spring term. An online form to allow students affected by canceled international credit-bearing programs to register for funding will be available by March 10 and must be submitted by March 20. Dartmouth will also offer options to participate in several online credit-bearing courses for undergraduate students who had been registered for the canceled international programs. A list of course offerings will be made available on March 16. Alternatively, Dartmouth will waive the transfer term fee of $2,200 to allow students to take courses near their homes or online from other qualified institutions.\nAny undergraduate students who are presently scheduled to be on campus for spring term but are interested in receiving a cash grant to pursue an off term or digital term should contact spring2020@dartmouth.edu. These requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on availability in this term as well as availability in later terms according to individual updated D-plans.\nWe continue to respond to--and plan for--the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. Ongoing efforts include:\nDINING SERVICES Dartmouth Dining Services has been taking steps to safeguard our community above and beyond our standard hygiene practices, including eliminating self-service dining options whenever possible; providing staff with hand-washing stations, sanitizer, gloves, and safety guidance at all self-service food areas; and personally greeting all customers before they enter busy locations to help emphasize proper sanitization.\nFACILITIES CLEANING In early February, Facilities Operations began increasing the disinfection of high-touch areas on campus. These include door entrance and egress hardware, classroom and other public furniture such as desks, tabletops, and the backs of chairs, stairway handrails, and public water fountains. The disinfectant used has been reviewed by Dartmouth's Environmental Health and Safety department and is effective at killing the coronavirus on a hard surface.\nDuring the winter break, we will perform additional cleaning of public bathrooms in all residential and nonresidential facilities. Additional hand sanitizer has been deployed at customer-service counters, circulation desks, and public computer stations across campus. Questions about the level of service and cleaning should be directed to facililties.operations.and.management@dartmouth.edu.\nPERSONAL HYGIENE Everyday actions can help prevent the spread of any type of respiratory virus. These include washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nREMOTE WORK POLICY Dartmouth has developed a plan for faculty and staff to work remotely in the event of voluntary or involuntary restrictions on reporting to work. The plan addresses potential scenarios and responses, pay continuation, job protection, and temporary alternative housing requests. The plan will not be activated unless it becomes necessary. Employees are encouraged to use telephone and video conferencing instead of face-to-face meetings as much as possible. Technology support services are available to employees who need assistance.\nCAMPUS EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES In accordance with guidance from the CDC and NHDHHS, Dartmouth is not prohibiting public events or activities at this time; however, event organizers should make appropriate decisions relative to their events in determining whether to cancel or proceed. Athletics and arts events that are currently scheduled for this weekend will continue as planned, and the continuation of these events will be assessed daily. Individual schools and programs can hold events, including academic seminars, as planned. We are reviewing the feasibility of holding Dimensions programming for admitted students and expect to make a determination on or before March 20.\nWe recommend that those who are holding events include timely reminders about maintaining good hygiene, such as washing hands, avoiding handshakes, and reminding individuals with possible symptoms that they should remain at home.\nFinally, please visit the Dartmouth COVID-19 website at dartmouth.edu/covid19 for ongoing updates and helpful information.\nThis is a stressful and unpredictable time for all of us, and we appreciate your cooperation and assistance. We are grateful for the efforts of the many people on campus who are working to respond to the need for ever-changing information and develop contingency plans for the entire institution. Together, we will continue to safeguard the health and well-being of our community.\nSincerely,\nJoseph Helble\nProvost", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/community-messages/march-6-2020-update"},

Individuals who have booked travel using a Dartmouth College corporate card, procurement card, or Dartmouth College check should note that the guidance may be different than for travelers who booked utilizing their personal credit cards/funds.\nPlease note that, per the Dartmouth Business Expense Policy, individuals are required to submit documentation of payment of business expenses. If any single business or travel expense is less than $75, documentation is not required, with exceptions related to business entertainment, gifts, lodging, relocation expenses, and NCAA-related expenses.\nAirfare\nIndividuals should make every effort to cancel their flight(s) before the scheduled departure time or the ticket will have no redeemable value.\nMany airlines are waiving change penalties through April 2020 and several are allowing cancellations. Each airline has different cancellation policies and penalties so individuals should contact their original booking channel to confirm if the airline has a waiver in place for their destination.\nIf travel was booked through Travel Leaders and the trip has been canceled, the changes can be made on the Travel Leaders booking site before the scheduled departure date. If an agent's assistance is required, please call during daytime hours, when the agent staffing levels are at the highest, to avoid the longer hold times that may be experienced with the after-hours service. The phone number for Travel Leaders is 603-646-3900.\nMany airline tickets, including non-refundable tickets, maintain their value for one year after the date of issue, after the cost of a change fee. The value can be applied to future travel for the same traveler on the same airline. Individuals should make every effort to use ticket credits for Dartmouth-related travel before purchasing new airline tickets.\nChange fees are typically deducted from the ticket value. If a change fee is charged as a separate fee, it will be paid by the College. Documentation will be required for payment of the change fee if the cost is greater than $75.\nThe cost of a canceled airline ticket will be paid by the College from the funding source the travel was to be funded from unless there are specific restrictions (see below).\nSome individuals utilize their personal credit cards for travel expenses. For airline tickets purchased on a personal credit card and canceled, the College will reimburse for any cancellation fees. If the College had already reimbursed the individual for the airline ticket costs and the trip was canceled, the individual is expected to pay back the reimbursed amount net of any cancellation charges or fees.\nLodging\nLodging vendors, including Airbnb hosts, strictly enforce cancellation penalties. Individuals should make every effort to cancel hotel reservations prior to the cancellation period defined in the hotel confirmation. Lodging cancellation fees are allowable expenses.\nConference Fees\nCancellations by conference attendee: If an individual cancels their conference attendance due to the current travel restrictions, conference registration fees or cancellation fees may be paid by Dartmouth at the department's discretion.\nIf an individual cancels their conference attendance due to the current travel restrictions, conference registration fees or cancellation fees may be paid by Dartmouth at the department's discretion. Cancellations by conference host: If a conference is canceled by the host, the conference attendees should seek reimbursement from the conference host. In the rare situation where the host will not reimburse, attendees should seek approval from the department for payment. Attendees should submit back-up documentation with the expense request for payment/reimbursement.\nDartmouth Coach Bus Tickets\nBus tickets booked through Dartmouth Coach may be used for services that operate in and out of Boston on any trip, in either direction, for up to one year from the date they were purchased. Rebooking tickets on the Boston services is unnecessary. Dartmouth Coach also offers free refunds (before expiration) if customers don't anticipate using a ticket.\nOn the reservation-based New York City services, Dartmouth Coach will waive all change fees and process refunds for any passenger who booked travel before May 1, 2020.\nVisit the Dartmouth Coach website for more information.\nRented Bus/Coach Bus\nTravel booked using a coach bus that needs to be canceled should be canceled as soon as possible.\nVisitors/Speakers\nIndividuals should refer to current campus event guidelines for specific information regarding dates/group size when determining whether to cancel Dartmouth-hosted events or conferences. This guidance is changing frequently and Dartmouth event organizers should use their judgment to determine whether to cancel future events.\nVisitors who were paid in advance for travel expenses are expected to reimburse Dartmouth for any refunds received if the travel is canceled. If the visitor is anticipating future Dartmouth-sponsored travel, the visitor can retain the airline credit in their name and use it for the future Dartmouth travel.\nPayment for services to performers/speakers is generally not payable if the activity is canceled. However, there may be a contract in place for these activities. Dartmouth sponsors should review the terms and conditions of these contracts to determine if payments are legally required when activity is canceled. If assistance is needed in reviewing contracts, please contact Dartmouth Procurement Services.\nGrant-Funded Travel\nPlease refer to the Dartmouth Office of Sponsored Projects website for guidance on canceled trips that were expected to be funded by grants.\nTravel Insurance\nDomestic travel insurance is not an allowable expense per the Dartmouth Business Expense policy.\nInternational travel insurance is an allowable expense under the Dartmouth Business Expense Policy; however, this insurance may not cover COVID-19-related claims.\nPrepayments for Students for Travel\nStudents who were paid in advance for travel expenses are expected to reimburse Dartmouth any refunds received if the travel is canceled. If the student is anticipating future Dartmouth-sponsored travel, the student can retain the airline credit in their name and use it for the future Dartmouth travel.\nCash Advances\nIndividuals who received cash advances prior to travel should return the cash advance if the travel is canceled. If there are extenuating circumstances with returning the cash advance, please contact the department sponsor.\nVisa Fees\nVisa fees related to costs will be covered by Dartmouth College if the travel was canceled.\nImmunizations\nImmunization costs will be covered by Dartmouth College if the travel was canceled.\nPersonal Expenses\nPersonal expenses related to canceled travel are not allowable Dartmouth business expenses.\nPosting of COVID-19-Related Expenses\nActivity/Subactivity Combinations for Transactions Related to COVID-19:\n766007-Extraordinary Circumstances, 1004-Coronavirus; to be used for student-related expenses\n346202-Emergency Operations, 1004-Coronavirus; to be used for all other expenses\nThese values should only be used for incremental costs or refunds of revenue that are unique to coronavirus preparation, mitigation or other activities or actions that have been approved by the Dartmouth COVID-19 Task Force or one of the related working groups. Examples include costs related to quarantine that would not otherwise have been incurred, extraordinary costs related to student travel, and refunds in revenues including tuition, and room and board (including any related reduction of scholarship). These activity/subactivity values should be used with the relevant department's org value and funding value.\nThese values should not be used for expenses such as travel that has been canceled or expenses related to on-campus activities that have been canceled or postponed (which may or may not have lost revenue associated with them). These are costs that are incurred in the normal course of a department's operations and should be charged to the chart string that those costs would normally be charged to. For these types of expenses, departments and divisions should use best efforts to identify the expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 during their Q3 projections. Examples of things that should not be charged to the above activities/subactivities include:\nOvertime costs for employees required because other team members are sick\nSupplies such as hand sanitizers that a department decides to purchase\nItems needed for operation of business continuity plans (laptops, etc.)\nIf you have questions about whether it is appropriate to use the established COVID-19 activity/subactivity values, please contact Dianne Ingalls.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/travel/travel-support-and-reimbursements"},
{"title": "March 8, 2020, Update", "text": "March 8, 2020, Update\nTo the Dartmouth community,\nNew Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) has announced that two additional people have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. One of those patients is an Upper Valley resident who had contact with a person who was later confirmed to have COVID-19 and is now in quarantine. That interaction occurred at Hope Bible Fellowship in West Lebanon on March 1. Vermont has also announced its first presumptive case that appears unrelated to the New Hampshire cases. Health officials are investigating the travel history and possible exposure history of the patients and are conducting contact tracing for anyone who has been in close contact with them.\nAt this time, NHDHHS is not recommending cancellation or postponement of mass events and gatherings and Dartmouth is not prohibiting public events or activities; however, event organizers should make appropriate decisions relative to their event in determining whether to cancel or proceed and attendees should contact event organizers for the status of individual events. We recommend that those who are holding events include timely reminders about maintaining good hygiene such as washing hands, avoiding handshakes, and reminding individuals with possible symptoms that they should remain at home.\nIn order to safeguard the health and well-being of everyone, Dartmouth is recommending that all members of our community begin practicing social distancing in order to minimize interactions with others and limit possible exposure to COVID-19. Social distancing means remaining away from settings where people are meeting, avoiding non-essential mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet) from others when possible. For more information, please visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html.\nUndergraduate final exams will proceed this week, and we are working with faculty to provide alternative testing locations to better facilitate social distancing options. Individual faculty members will be in touch with specific updates for those in large classes. Geisel graduate school classes are being evaluated and faculty will be in contact regarding any changes to classroom locations. Dining services will continue as normal with current heightened cleaning and serving protocols\nWe recognize that these actions may create significant challenges for faculty, staff, and students, and we ask for your understanding as we respond to events as they unfold.\nThe CDC recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of any type of respiratory virus, including washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nIf you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, please stay home. Dartmouth students should contact Dick's House, at 603-646-9400 and faculty and staff should contact their primary care provider. Before going to a health care appointment, please call ahead and tell them about any recent travel and your symptoms. Also, avoid contact with others and do not travel.\nWe will continue to share updates as this situation evolves.

{"title": "Community Conversations, June 24, 2020 Transcript", "text": "JUNE 24 COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS TRANSCRIPT\nJoseph Helble:\nWelcome everyone to our seventh community conversation, addressing planning, response, and operations in the time of COVID-19 at Dartmouth College. I'm Joe Helble, the provost at Dartmouth College, joining you from Starr Instructional Studio in Berry Library for take two of our seventh conversation after a brief hiatus, one we planned and one last week when I was not quite 100%. Thanks to all of you for your patience and well wishes, but we're back with an update this week. I'm joined again, and as usual, by Justin Anderson, our vice president for communications, who's joining me from an adjacent studio on campus.\nAnd today, once again, we're pleased to be joined by two individuals who can speak to some of the considerations that all colleges and universities are facing relating to testing and contact tracing considerations for all of us as we anticipate the return of our undergraduate and graduate student community in larger numbers to campus this fall. They are Dr. Joanne Conroy, a member of the Dartmouth Class of 1977, MD, CEO, and president of Dartmouth-Hitchcock and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health. And she is joining us from her office at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.\nAnd we are also joined by Neal Katyal, a member of the Dartmouth Class of 1991, a practicing attorney, the Saunders Professor of National Security Law at Georgetown University, and the former acting solicitor general of the United States. Neal is joining us from his home in Washington, D.C. Both of our guests will be with us today in their personal capacities as alumni and Neal, also as a Dartmouth parent of an undergraduate student. As always, I'll provide a brief campus update. We'll take your questions live moderated by Justin, and then have a conversation with campus and community leaders, in this case, Joanne and Neal.\nToday, I'd like to focus on providing brief updates on our research and libraries reopening once again because progress continues to be made in the phased reopening in both of those areas that are so important to the members of our scholarly research and teaching communities who are here resident in Hanover this summer, and an update on our academic and operational planning as we look ahead to fall 2020 and beyond. First, I'll start with the research update. We are now halfway through the fourth week of what has been and remains an intentionally and thoughtfully phased reopening.\nPhases 1, 1A, and 1B as we've referred to them each lasted approximately one week and we are now presently in what we are referring to in conversations with our laboratory principal investigators, phase 1C. In all phases, several aspects of what we've been requiring has not changed by design. First, we are asking everyone who can work remotely to continue working remotely. Our basic rule at this time remains one person per lab, disinfecting the work surfaces and equipment before and after each work shift in the research laboratory. Core facilities are accessible only if an environmental health and safety approved plan is in place.\nAnd we are asking everyone both in the laboratories and not who is accessing campus facilities to conduct a daily check in using the TSA questionnaire. And we are asking principal investigators, laboratory leaders, PIs, to verify the adherence of their research community to the protocol and remind them daily of the importance in doing so. I said a moment ago, we've moved to phase 1C, what phase 1C permits is an extension of the hours of operation now to encompass the beginning of weekends. Specifically, this weekend, Saturday, June 27, Saturday only, facilities will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for research.\nDuring the weekdays, facility hours have been extended to 8 a.m. to midnight, Monday to Friday. The following weekend, July 4, and yes, I'm aware that July 4 is a holiday weekend, but nonetheless, our staff has committed to helping our research community make this work. The facilities will be open both Saturday and Sunday, July 4 and July 5 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now, in terms of the details, if someone is working only in a distinct core facility, they do not need to count against the one person per lab limit.\nSo students or faculty or post-doctoral researchers and research staff who may be working in facilities like the electron microscope facility, the flow-cytometry lab, the light-microscope facility, the advanced-imaging core center at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, and many other of our core facilities do not count against the one person per laboratory limit. If faculty members can enter their offices without entering the lab, they also do not need to count themselves against the one person per lab limit. And what we have seen from the numbers with this phased and staged and thoughtful reopening from one, to 1A, to 1B, to 1C is indeed a gradual ramp up of activity, which we had hoped to see in undertaking this transition in this measured way.\nAccording to vice provost for research, Dean Madden, as of Friday, June 5, in phase 1, the final day of phase 1, we had 169 researchers visiting nine of our main research buildings. At the start of phase 1B, Monday, June 8, 211 individuals, an increase of 25 percent over the end of phase 1. And a week later as of Monday, June 15, 246 individuals working in the research facilities, an increase of 46 percent over the end of phase 1. Now, I also want to acknowledge that many faculty, particularly those with larger groups and laboratories, and many of whom I heard from directly this weekend have been asking when multi-person access to the labs will become possible.\nThis is what the working group and the task force have characterized as phase 2 operation and it is a phase we hope and in fact, intend to be able to enter in early July. So, I ask the research community for just a little bit more patience as the task force and working group work through their checklist of considerations that need to be addressed so we can continue to go down this path in a thoughtful, measured, and structured way. We have been able to do this with adherence to the protocols and without incident across the board through phase 1A, 1B, and now 1C, and we are optimistic that by continuing adherence to protocol, phase two can be equally successful.\nWith July right around the corner, I anticipate more detail on our phase 2 reopening very soon. Also, worth noting in the area of research before I move on to the libraries is the increase in research proposal volume that we have observed as against one year ago. Comparing data from March 2019 to March 2020 and April 2019 to April 2020, in terms of grant proposal submissions, we found that 2020 mirrored 2019. There was virtually no change in the number of proposals submitted. However, according to Vice Provost Madden, the number of submissions, which included some supplements related to COVID-19 work in May of 2020 was up 25% over May 2019.\nFor those who track this kind of thing, it means to me certainly, and to others, that our researchers clearly used this period of working from home to focus on writing proposals and presumably writing papers and journal manuscripts as one might expect and hope, an encouraging sign for the research activity at Dartmouth during this challenging period. In the area of libraries, and as I've said before, I often speak of these together because of the importance of both laboratories and the libraries to our teaching mission and to our research mission, we are moving forward with plans to begin a phased reopening of the libraries very soon.\nI'm pleased to report that the library remains on track to consider the first phase of reopening by mid-July and perhaps even sooner. Initial access will be to Baker-Berry stacks and the research collections and initial access will be for Dartmouth ID holders only. Dartmouth ID holders encompassing faculty, staff, and students who are authorized to be here and working on campus during the summer. Special collections, including Rauner, will have more limited access and will be by appointment only, but they too will be accessible in this early phase of reopening. And I anticipate more details prior to the July 4 holiday, again, with the goal of reopening the library facilities to limited use in very early to mid-July.\nEither way, depending upon the exact progression, we'll be sharing in writing the details with the campus and we will include the update on our COVID-19 website once this has been finalized. Now, let me turn to budget briefly before I address the larger topic that's I think on everyone's minds right now with our June 29 announcement date right around the corner, and that is budgetary planning. As the president, and I have said repeatedly, our operations this fall, of course, depend upon the number of students we will have on campus and also what those operations will look like.\nI have said in the past, and I will say again this afternoon, that fall operations are highly, highly unlikely to be what we would characterize as business as usual operation. Large gatherings, whether for social events, performance events or fully filled classrooms are not likely. This is something that we are seeing mirrored in announcements that other campuses and organizations are making around the country around their fall terms and it applies to us here at Dartmouth as well because of our attention on community health and public health in making operational decisions.\nAs we work on our academic planning, which again, I'll discuss shortly, we continue to work on a challenging financial picture. The uncertainty regarding the number of students back on campus, the mix of remote and residential students, and a result, uncertain levels of private support from individuals and organizations that help support our operations in the face of a challenging national economy, this being the case for many nonprofit organizations, including colleges and universities like Dartmouth, mean that it is difficult for us to project a typical optimistic financial picture for the year ahead.\nGiven that, I and the campus leadership continue to meet with different committees and the president senior leadership group to review updated projections on FY20 close, the fiscal year that closes next Tuesday, June 30, to look at and adjust as appropriate and needed in the face of core operations, FY21 budgets, and to begin to develop plans for fall term operations and the year beyond. We do know that we will be asking, and I will be asking, all units on this campus to start by making adjustments in their non-compensation spending as an important first element asking each of us to look carefully at what we have all done so successfully in reducing non-compensation spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 20.\nThe level that we will be asking is reduced from the fourth quarter of FY20 when spread out over a year, recognizing that it is extremely challenging to maintain that for a full year, but leaders will have discretion. Specifics will come from deans and unit leaders in the coming weeks as we work out the details of individual FY21 non-comp and overall budget targets with each of the unit leaders in the days to come.\nAnd let me close by speaking about academic operations in the fall. I'll say again, and I can't stress this often enough, from the outset, President Hanlon and I have stressed our goal of supporting the maximum number of students we can return to campus guided first and foremost, by the application of appropriate public health standards. Community health, our students, our faculty, our staff, and the broader Upper Valley community is at the forefront of our minds in our decision making. Our decisions are informed by input and recommendations from many groups first and foremost, federal and state guidance, including updated guidance from the state of New Hampshire, Department of Education, specifically for institutions of higher education, which we anticipate being released within the next several days. Our task force working diligently since the very beginning of 2020, helping provide recommendations and options through its many working groups and helping me and others in leadership make decisions about operations, again, with campus safety and security and public health at the fore of our considerations.\nThe academic working group consisting of deans, associate deans, and two members of the faculty, the teaching faculty and the dean of the college helping advise on academic options and decision makings and a health working group working jointly with Dr. Joanne Conroy and her colleagues at DHMC to make decisions related to testing and monitoring of community health. Now, I said in our last gathering, taking into account the input and guidance from all of these groups, that we were diligently moving toward a full-year solution rather than a fall-term-only solution.\nI can state with certainty today that our plans that will be announced this coming Monday, June 29, will in fact reflect our planning for the full year and not just the fall term. The full academic year will mean the full academic year, fall term 2020 through summer term 2021, a full four-quarter, integrated, academic term. We anticipate and fully expect that all Dartmouth undergraduate students will have the opportunity to be here residentially for part of their education in the upcoming academic year, but they will not all be able to be here on campus at exactly the same time.\nOur academic terms will be full-term and not divided with students coming and going in the middle of the term. A full quarter will be a full quarter for those students who are in residence during that quarter. First-year students will be treated as a cohort and thus have the same residential terms and our goal for all students is to offer two residential terms for every returning student who can and chooses to be on campus this upcoming academic year. We anticipate that beyond the first-year class, other students will be able to express some preference in determining which terms work best with their academic plan of study, which terms work best for them to be physically present in Hanover.\nAnd these are some of the details that we are finalizing and are not prepared to announce today but will be outlined in the final announcement that we will release, President Hanlon and I, on Monday of next week. Now, we also anticipate that, as many others have announced, much of our teaching may well be done via remote learning, even for those physically present in Hanover, at least for the fall term. Details on numbers, sequence, approach, and incorporation of student preference, all of these important details that I am sure are on the minds of every student who's tuned in to hear us this afternoon, are things that we will be announcing by Monday, June 29, as part of our comprehensive announcement. We do anticipate that we will be asking everyone who returns to campus, every student, to consent to testing for the virus upon arrival. This will be PCR-based viral testing, utilizing Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Dr. Joanne Conroy's colleagues, as our local partner. We presently anticipate retesting all students shortly afterwards, so-called double-testing, to do our best, to have a good handle on whether or not there are levels of infection present in our community that need to be addressed through quarantine and isolation as students return.\nWe are also examining a variety of methods to screen for infection in our community and recognize, and ask our students and our community to recognize, that additional surveillance testing may well be part of our protocol and expectation for all who choose to be with us on campus during the fall term. In other words, and I'll say this as clearly as I can, additional testing in some manner will occur throughout the term and in an evidence-based manner, details and frequency being two of the things we are working on finalizing and being able to announce to the extent that we can in Monday's announcement. We will also be asking all students to consent to contact tracing, and we are exploring both what I call analog or human-based and digital technology-based approaches. As is the case for all colleges and universities, we recognize that this contact tracing and this testing, this combined protocol, raises very important questions about privacy, which need to be thought through by all of us. And that, in fact, is one of the reasons why I'm pleased to have our alumnus Neal Katyal joining us today.\nFall will be different than a typical term for residential students here and elsewhere. As I've said repeatedly at this time, we anticipate that large gatherings, social gatherings, and classroom gatherings will simply not be permissible. At this time, we also anticipate that masks in common areas and the limits on the size of gatherings will be in place certainly throughout fall term. And that consistent with these guidelines, we will be asking students to acknowledge and accept these conditions as a statement of community principles to help ensure we are doing everything we can collectively to support and protect the health of every member of our community. I should also note that we are currently planning for the fall academic term, if I haven't said this already, to start on time on Monday, Sept. 14.\nNow, I share these details this afternoon to let you know the current thinking of the task force and of our leadership, rather than remaining quiet and asking you to wait until Monday's announcement. But I also share these and ask you to understand that details can change, in fact, between now and Monday, and certainly between now and the time that our students return to campus in September. I know that the outlines of the approach that I have just articulated will elicit many questions. How many students will be back at any one time? Will it differ term to term? Who will they be? How will we decide which students get preference? When will students need to come back? Will they need to quarantine? When and where will that occur? These are many important questions, and these are among the details that we are finalizing and will be addressed again in our final announcement of plans by June 29.\nSo, let me simply stop there and say thank you again to the Dartmouth community. Thank you to everyone who's asking such important questions about reopening of research in the laboratories. Thank you to those who have been working so diligently to ask questions about maintaining social distancing and public health protections in classrooms and our research laboratories. Thanks to all of you who have been asking about steps we can take to make the remote learning experience for our students who will be engaging in remote learning either well, physically present in Hanover or well working from home during a remote term in the upcoming academic year as engaging, stimulating, and challenging as possible, and part of a true Dartmouth educational experience. And let me say to the full community, not only do I appreciate your patience as we work through these difficult questions, but your continuing dedication to the learning of our students and the research and scholarship that's conducted here on this campus to support the advancement of knowledge in society is truly inspiring. So, thank you, and I'm happy to pause and take a few questions before we turn to Joanne Conroy and Neal Katyal to continue the discussion. Justin?\nJustin Anderson:\nThank you, Joe, and it's truly nice to see you today, back in the chair and in front of the camera, updating us and taking questions. The first question that I'm going to ask is really based on news of today, and it's premised on the news that there's a large uptick in cases. Before we came on the air, I saw that reported cases today are at the highest number since April. And so, this questioner asks, are there any concerns for the fall plan given the current increase of infections across many states in the country?\nHelble:\nThat's a really good question, Justin. The best answer I can give, to some of you who know me, I'm data obsessed. I collect and monitor data because it's important in helping me make my own decisions based on input and recommendations and feedback I'm giving. And I have been tracking infection rates in this country from a variety of sources, and also fatality rates in this country from a variety of sources since early March. And there certainly has been nationally, a fairly noticeable uptick in the number of infections over the course of the past week. Meanwhile, the number of daily fatalities associated with COVID-19 has continued to decline. So, these are two pieces of information that the task force, that our health management working for us, and I will be watching very, very closely. Because there's so much attention being paid to it, because there is so much conversation about the need potentially in some states to re-tighten restrictions, to reverse trends that are starting to emerge, I'm going to remain cautiously optimistic that given where we are in late June and given that students will not be returning to campus until late August to the early September timeframe, that we can take steps to bring this back under control to a level that we're comfortable having students return to campus from across the country.\nAnd even having said that, we are intending to put in place the testing and monitoring protocol precisely to be able to isolate infected members of our community very quickly and do our best to prevent them from contributing to community spread. So, it's an important thing for us to watch. We're watching the numbers. We're taking the guidance of state and federal officials quite seriously, and we are also fully cognizant that the situation in four weeks could be different than the situation it is today in either direction, and we need to be prepared to make operating-decision adjustments accordingly.\nAnderson:\nJoe, given your mention of testing in the open, getting a lot of questions about testing. One question here says, \"Do you feel Dartmouth has the capacity to adequately test a high number of people on campus?\" And this will be a good question for you to speak with Joanne about, how many tests can D-H process a day?\nHelble:\nI could answer that question, but I'd rather put that one to Joanne since she will be, she and her colleagues, providing the testing capabilities. So I'll let her speak to numbers, but the answer is yes, this is something that our colleagues, the joint working group that Joanne and I put in place well over a month ago, these are precisely the kinds of questions that they've been addressing, and they are confident that D-H has the capacity and will have the capacity to provide the testing needs that we need to help test and support the health of the community. We will be likely bringing students back over a period of several days, rather than having everyone move in on a single day, and part of the reason for doing that, the details again, to be announced on Monday, are so that we can effectively test everyone as they arrive, using the resources of D-H that will be devoted to supporting Dartmouth in this effort.\nAnderson:\nAlso, Joe, a lot of questions about who will be returning in the fall and beyond. And I know you've touched on this multiple times, but I think it's important to perhaps touch on it again; is thought being given to students who may need resources such as laboratories and machine shops for their research? And then likewise, what about consideration being given to students who might not have access at home to a reliable wifi connection or laptops?\nHelble:\nYep. So again, I will say these are the details we are working out. But in terms of broad principles, we are going to give students the opportunity to express some choice in the terms that they would like to be on campus. We will be asking that they do that consistent with their need to access facilities and the progress they need to make toward their academic degree. We will be taking into consideration certainly students' economic circumstances, home circumstances, ability to travel, and ability to work in an environment at home with perhaps more limited access to technology, as considerations that we will use in deciding when certain students may need to have priority access or preferred access to our facilities.\nAnd so broad brush, we will be indicating preferred terms for different groups of students, but we have not yet finalized those details. That will be one of the two terms. The other two terms, students will be in a position to express choice. The first-year students, however, will be together as a cohort, so we will look to keep all of them here on campus, the same two residential terms to community amongst that class at the very start of their Dartmouth education. And for students who have other compelling reasons that make it important for them to be here at particular times, we are going to be doing everything we can to accommodate those individual needs. I'll ask the community to be patient and work with us, because I promise you there will be many students who have questions they need to ask, and we will not physically be able to answer all of those in the first few days, but we are going to do our best to work through individual student questions and take individual circumstances into account.\nAnderson:\nAnd then, Joe, in terms of when students come back, a questioner asks about on-campus living as opposed to off-campus living and whether or not all students who return will have to live on-campus or whether or not living off-campus will be an option.\nHelble:\nWe anticipate, Justin, that there will be a small number of students who will be living in private housing off-campus. So, we are working on the parameters testing and otherwise for those students, because they are an important part of the Dartmouth and Upper Valley community, and we will be asking them to adhere to the same protocols for students who are living in our living spaces. We are designing this with the expectation that the vast majority of students who are here with us will be living in on-campus residence halls. De-densified on-campus residence halls but living in on-campus residence halls. So, dare I say, the short answer, yes, there will be some students living in private housing in the community. Details will be more fully articulated in the announcement on Monday.\nAnderson:\nAnd we have time for one more question before we go to our guests. But before I get to that, I just want to recognize that I'm getting a lot of questions about the status of athletics. And I want to let everyone know that that will be a decision that's made by the Ivy League, which we are expecting in July. So, more detail and more specifics about the athletic seasons to come by next month. And Joe, the last question is, like the former question about living spaces, a questioner points out the importance of singles, both as a protection from the virus and your ability to isolate as well also as your ability to take online courses. So, the questioner wants to know, is this something that is being considered?\nHelble:\nShort answer is yes. We are, as I said, de-densifying our residence halls. And although the details will be more fully articulated on Monday, I am comfortable saying today that students will either be assigned to singles or two students to a two-room double where every student will have their own bedroom. So, we are very aware of the importance of students having individual space that is theirs. Very aware of individual students having individual space that is theirs to study, not just to live and sleep. We are maintaining space within our residence halls for quarantine and isolation space as well. We are trying hard to do our best to utilize our facilities in a way that enables us to manage student health through utilization of the facilities. This is one of the reasons why we are de-densifying in the way that we are, rather than trying to maximize the number of students we can house in our residence halls. I've said this before, it's intentionally [inaudible] approach.\nJustin, I lost you for a second there. So, thank you, Justin. Thank you for the questions. And so, given that, and thank you all for the questions that have come in from outside. I'd now like to turn to our two distinguished guests, alumni guests, who are here with us today. As I said, we're joined by Dr. Joanne Conroy, the CEO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock, and Neal Katyal, member of the Dartmouth class of 1991, professor at Georgetown University, and former acting solicitor general of the United States. Neal, Joanne, great to see you, great to have you with us almost back in Hanover on screen this afternoon. Thanks so much for joining\nJoanne Conroy:\nHappy to be here.\nHelble:\nJoanne, I'd like to start with a question for you given the number of questions Justin has already put my way about testing. Testing's clearly, as the questioners indicated, a really important component, not only of our diagnosis of symptomatic individuals, but monitoring and supporting Dartmouth community health. You were asked directly, or I was asked directly and I'm passing it to you, about capacity. And let me expand on that and ask about the kinds of tests that you will use. What can you say broadly about what D-H is doing and then perhaps more specifically about what will be used to support the Dartmouth student and faculty and staff community through Dartmouth-Hitchcock's partnership?\nConroy:\nSure. We do a nasopharyngeal swab currently. That is really the most reliable way to actually collect the sample for coronavirus. Many people have asked us about saliva testing, but we really have not been able to validate that that has the sensitivity and specificity that we would need.\nWe can do 1,000 tests a day and we expect to receive a third machine, which would actually expand our capacity to 1,500. You get results overnight, so it's actually quite fast. And for actually the majority of the students that come back on campus and faculty, there is a way to really create a cadence for testing, so people get their results very quickly. And then can enter into either quarantine or go about their business with the knowledge that at least at that moment in time they were negative.\nNow, let me say that if people don't have symptoms, the test is a snapshot. We do know that there are additional tests that actually we're doing some research on right now, which is testing a wastewater. And we know that the virus is actually excreted in the stool five to seven days before people have symptoms. So, we're working with your leadership in order to figure out how we can use that as a surveillance tool. We're also working with the towns of Lebanon and Hanover, and people are really excited about it. They've been doing it in Europe for a long time, and it's just something we're integrating into a level of surveillance here.\nHelble:\nAs a scientist and former environmental engineer, although this was not my specific area of expertise, I have to say I was quite thrilled to hear about this development and our ability to partner with you and also with the community to explore this. And so is it fair to say, Joanne, based on what you've just said, that we have a protocol in place today that we know we could use and will deploy when students return, but we are also exploring alternate modalities of sampling and testing, which may mean that when the students are in fact here in early September, the protocol and testing modality that we employ is a little bit different than what we envision today, we're going to take these next two months to make sure that we have exactly the right set of strategies to monitor community health? Is that fair?\nConroy:\nThat's true. Actually, the research is starting, I think, next week. So, we think it's actually going to proceed very rapidly to do a pilot. And then we may have another way of doing surveillance. That's a little bit more less intrusive than a nasopharyngeal swab. So, let's put it that way.\nHelble:\nThank you, Joanne. So, next, I'd like to turn to Neal now, because some of the things you said raise questions about ... You talked about the potential level of intrusion that some may feel with a nasopharyngeal swab being used to collect sample. And that's the question of my own personal privacy. So bringing students back to campus in an environment that's prioritized supporting community health means of course that we're asking students and members of the campus community to consent to testing such as what Joanne just indicated, and to agree to take protective measures such as social distancing, the wearing of masks in public places, and consent to contact tracing, perhaps even using technology as well as human contact tracers. Many colleges, universities, and private sector organizations are certainly grappling with these same issues. And although you are here in your capacity as an alumnus and a Dartmouth parent, you certainly have some knowledge in this area having argued many major privacy cases, including before the Supreme Court over the course of your career. So how do you personally think about these privacy considerations, about communicating them to students, and the things we will be asking students to in fact give a little on in exchange for the ability to get an education?\nNeal Katyal:\nWell, thank you, provost. Maybe before starting, I just want to say I've never been prouder to be a Dartmouth alum than now, and I'm always darn proud of it, but from start to finish the way that the College has handled coronavirus has been inspiring. I just remember from the very early days I saw President Hanlon give a speech about how coronavirus underscores the real need for a Dartmouth education, a liberal arts education that's broad based, and particularly with the race relations and Black Lives Matter stuff, that Dartmouth education is so important. And the thoughtful way I think that the College has been going about this underscores this.\nI teach at Georgetown Law School. Harvard Law School just did the simple thing and said, \"Oh, we're not going to let anyone back next year at all.\" And I think the College, from just watching what's been going on, has tried every way in trying to balance things really seriously and understand the cost to not having an on-campus experience. And so, what you're saying today about, for example, having the first years be together as a cohort just moves me so much because if that's what Dartmouth is about, is trying to keep our community together, even when there's unprecedented threats.\nThe way I think about your question is I think it's often false. There's a lot of people who say the trade-off is always privacy versus security, and it's pitted that way as if they're mutually exclusive. But often, you have privacy or liberty on both sides of the equation. And I think coronavirus is a really good example of that because, if we don't restrict our students' liberties in some way, we just can't open at all as a college. And that's a far greater intrusion of liberty and imposition on them. And so, for that reason, I think schools have historically tried to balance health and wellbeing with student liberty, and so, for example, everyone's got to get a certain number of vaccinations before they can attend a college. There's got to be doctors' examinations and things like that. And so, some steps, when we talk about testing, the swabs and stuff, seemed to me firmly within that tradition and what we've done before.\nI think more broadly, as we think about having students wear masks or having certain social distancing, that's not all that different than schools that have codes of conduct, that bar unhealthy behavior that has externalities or harm to other students. We ban hazing, things like that. Schools do have some ability and should have some ability to restrict absolute student freedom for the sake of the community. And so, I think the question is, what does that process look like? How is it done? Is it done in a slapdash manner, in a thoughtful one? And on all of that, I think it's gone marvelously well from my external perspective, as both an alum and a new Dartmouth parent. I'm really pleased.\nThe one other thing I would just say about this is sometimes people say, \"Oh, consent, you consent to go to Dartmouth. Therefore, the College can do whatever.\" And that, I think, is a pretty mindless way to think about it. It's true that everyone does exercise a certain amount of volition in going there, but it is different, particularly if you're already at the College. I don't think it's enough to just simply say, \"Oh, you're a senior. You choose to come back, therefore we can do whatever we want as a College.\" Because, after all, they don't fully have a choice to come back. They want to graduate from the College and the like. And so, I think balancing those kinds of student liberty, privacy concerns still are important, and I'm pleased with how it's been going so far.\nHelble:\nThank you, Neal. Thanks very much. That's really helpful to hear, and it's always nice to hear perspective of an alum who has a sense to see many organizations and institutions and has helpful thoughts on how Dartmouth has been approaching this.\nJoanne, I'd like to turn back to you and just ask a question about how you've managed things within DHMC. And we've spoken about this before in another context, it was an alumni forum. But I note that in addition to being our testing partner, DHMC is of course the major medical center for the Hanover region. And you attracted some attention, or I'll say we attracted some attention, for having the first confirmed case in this region several months ago. But since then you have managed this disease extraordinarily well as a community. What did you learn from that first case, or your first few cases, and what steps have you taken to protect patients and visitors as well as your employees that might be relevant to institutions of higher education who are faced with exactly the same need?\nConroy:\nThat's a really big question. So, let me first talk about the first case that we had. That was an employee. And I think we're on the pages of the New York Times and Boston Globe, because they chose not to stay in quarantine. They chose to go to a party. And we learned from that, that, number one, we have to be really explicit with people about what our expectations are when they are symptomatic. And we become very explicit. When you're in quarantine, you go home and you're home for 14 days. And we pay you if you're an employee. We pay you to stay home. And we expect you to meet all the expectations that we give you on quarantine.\nWhat that first patient did, though, which was actually on February 28, is it activated the entire Upper Valley. So, we started canceling large meetings, we canceled many fundraisers. And I'd have to say the Upper Valley community has been a great partner. They've taken this to heart. They self-quarantine if they're ill, they stay at home, they wear masks, they obey all the rules to stay healthy.\nHowever, we have over 6,000 employees here. And we have people coming in and out of the institution all the time. How do you keep it safe for people? Number one, we have a mandatory masking. So, everybody wears a mask, everybody that works here. I'm in my office and that's the only reason why I don't have a mask on. If you're in your office alone, you can take your mask off. The second thing is we know that the virus actually is spread through the mucus membranes of your eyes. So, when you have patient-facing contact, we actually have people wear face shields. And we also have all of our employees really committed to not coming to work if they have a temperature. We monitor temperature and we ask people whether or not they've been out of state and whether or not they feel well that day when they come in the institution. But right now, employees know that it's OK to remote-in, that it's not a negative to say, \"I don't feel well. I think I'm going to call in for my meetings.\" And that's really helped keep the institution safe.\nI can tell you, though, that we have had employees become positive because of community spread. And at any one time we will contact trace throughout the organization and put people that have been close contacts on quarantine. So, I could have 50 to 150 people on quarantine at any time. We're very aggressive about it. And that's actually how you stop the spread of the disease, is identify everybody's close contacts.\nI never thought that I might have to tell people, give a list of people who I was with five days ago. You never really thought about that, but that's the type of contact tracing we are trying to do so we can really isolate and contain any community spread.\nHelble:\nRight. Great. Thank you, Joanne. So, Neal, let me turn to you for one last question and then we'll open it up to our audience. I know you've done some work around the world in this area, and I just wanted to ask if you've seen any organizations or governments do this particularly well. Use contact tracing and testing to manage and eventually reduce the spread of the disease. And if they have, how have they done that while managing to balance the privacy considerations that we spoke about a moment ago?\nKatyal:\nI've been particularly impressed with South Korea. I've seen a bunch of briefings from the folks who've run the response there. The leader of whom is Dr. Jerome Kim, who used to be a colonel in our army and went over there. And they first had MERS back three or four years ago and learned a lot from that. And I think that there's three elements to what they've done, and they've reduced new infections to almost zero, even though they had the first patient the same time we, the United States, did.\nThe first part is massive testing. They ordered a bunch of tests, they test everyone, and they test them frequently. The second is visitor quarantines, so that if you come into the country, you've got to be quarantined for a period of days. I think it's 14. And then the third is digital tracing. There is stuff on your cell phone, and basically it alerts you if you have been in contact with someone else who has tested positive.\nWhat they found is that actually anonymizing the data helped with digital tracing. That is, people were afraid of being traced, where they were going and things like that. And so, as a result, what they've done is hide a lot of personal identifying information so that you get this information and you use it, but it's not as if it's big brother using it in some way, shape, or form.\nI think all three of those things together have been incredibly important. It was moving to the point of tears to see what South Korea had done in reducing the spread and how they're able now essentially to function much like the pre-COVID era and compare it to what's happened in the United States. Certainly, I don't think the United States as a whole could do everything South Korea did. But a smaller college like Dartmouth, I think, is wise to consider steps that as a government, we can't impose, but as a small, somewhat geographically or remote private place, I think could. And then the last thing I'd say is, as we think about returning to college in the fall, our students are different now. This is not March of 2020, where this is just hitting and we're all scrambling to figure out what we're doing.\nThey've now lived with social distancing for a long period of time. They're used to masks, they understand the power of masks in reducing the R0, the infection rate and the like. So, I do think while it might've been very dangerous to bring some students back earlier. Now they've all and will continue to live with a lot of these restrictions even before they get back to campus. And that gives me a lot of hope that this solution will work.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thank you, Neal. So, thanks to both you and Joanne for some great and really insightful answers, Justin, I'd like to turn to you and see what questions our audience is asking of Neal and Joanne.\nAnderson:\nYeah. Thanks Joe. And thank you, Joanne and Neal for joining us today. Some interesting questions have already come in, but Joanne, I want to start with a question for you. That's similar to a question posed to Joe and that's about the increase in cases across the country. I'm wondering what you make of that and how we in the Upper Valley should think about that, given that our rate thankfully remains so low.\nConroy:\nSo, our prevalence rate (of positive COVID-19 tests) in the community is less than 2.5% and that's a positive rate, very, very low. We watch the numbers of positive cases every single day by county. When Massachusetts was exploding, we were watching the southern part of the state. And what's interesting is we actually did not see a migration of those cases up 93 or Route 3 from Massachusetts, as we expected. I think that what it really gets down to the three things that we already talked about. It's about managing symptoms and aggressive testing. It's about contact tracing and it's about quarantining. And as long as you're really aggressive about doing those basic public health approaches to keeping the community safe, we believe we can actually contain this.\nAnderson:\nAnd Neal, I want to go back to something that you and Joe were talking about, and that is Dartmouth's ability or right to impose testing on its community. I want to flip that around, based on a question that I got in terms of the rights of students or faculty or staff. And are they able to basically say, \"I don't want a test. I don't want to be tested.\" So how would that be handled?\nKatyal:\nYeah, well, I think the thought gets into the realm of the law. I'm really only here in my capacity, more an alum and kind of scholar. So, I suspect that there may be some challenges that someone might want to bring it to some college or university that did that. I would hope here though, that folks recognize that the community's health in this unique pandemic depends on everyone doing their part. That means everything from submitting to testing, to possibly digital tracing, to as Joanne was saying, don't come to work if you're sick or don't come to class, if you're sick or got a fever or something like that.\nI can't underscore enough that the successful models around the world like South Korea are ones in which people took that community responsibility really seriously. And again, that's what gives me hope, because if any place can do that in this country, even though we're so divided on so many things, it's Dartmouth with its shared sense of community and respect for one another. So, there's the legal or rights question on one side, but there's also just what's prudent and thoughtful as a member of a community on the other.\nAnderson:\nJoanne in terms of testing, someone writes in to ask whether or not the test results will be private. If and when someone tests positive, who is informed of that, and then just sort of more broadly, are you doing research right now that might involve some of these tests of community members?\nConroy:\nSo, let me answer the second question first is, I think we submitted about 25 proposals between March and the end of April to do COVID research. It's not just research on the numbers because I think a lot of people are looking at that, but we have a number of people looking at and working with the people that they're to kind of look at may be overnight at-home testing and what it would take to pull that off. And working with companies to commercialize it.\nSo, the whole area of research and testing is moving very quickly. We also do antibody testing here and so we can do serology. We do a lot of work in all of that space. In terms of, I don't know what the College is going to do with the test results. I can tell you that when somebody is registered as a patient and they're assigned into my chart, because of patient privacy, HIPAA issues, they get their test results and that becomes their healthcare privacy responsibility. I don't know what the College has arranged with the students to have them then self-report back to the College, but it is owned by the patient, the individual owns their test result.\nAnderson:\nNeal, back to you, just building off of what you said about the great job that South Korea has done in sort of managing the outbreak. Have you seen or do you know of any examples in this country of institutions of higher education or just institutions in general that have had similar luck by approaching it either in a way that South Korea did or in a sort of a modified approach?\nKatyal:\nYeah. Nothing yet because I think the country's just starting to reopen, so we don't have very many models. I mean, we can look at, I guess, hospitals and how they've managed because they've had to stay open or Amazon or something like that. But nothing to my mind has been tremendously moving or have enough data on. The one thing I'm very optimistic about is the Notre Dame plan of bringing students back earlier, starting there a couple of weeks before I think maybe August 20 or so. As opposed to their normal start date in September, ending school before Thanksgiving. Notably, that's exactly the Dartmouth plan already in terms of ending school before Thanksgiving. So that gives us, again, I think, a unique structural advantage over some of our other institutions. It sounds that's something that the College is leveraging a bit and as they think about the solution.\nAnderson:\nAnd Joanne back to you with a specific question based on something you said earlier about the wastewater treating. Which I think that possibility is interesting and a viewer writes in to ask how targeted can that be, would it be, you would be able to determine if it was a specific residence hall, would it be that or could it be potentially that specific?\nConroy:\nWell, we've been working with a college and our research team is delighted to find out that we can actually target residence halls at Dartmouth, which is great. As we work with the towns, there are certain ways that the wastewater effluent actually enters into the treatment facility. And sometimes it's not that specific. So, we have a real opportunity here to really identify if there's a residence hall that we need to kind of put on quarantine. I guess the challenge is how do you make quarantine cool for these students? Because I don't know, sitting in my dorm room for two weeks is not too cool. So, we're going to have to figure out how to make quarantine cool for these students.\nKatyal:\nIt's not Harvard, we'll figure out a way to make it cool.\nConroy:\nThat will be our challenge.\nAnderson:\nYeah, Neal, so how do you make quarantine cool? That would be my question to you.\nKatyal:\nYou're asking the uncoolest guy in the room.\nHelble:\nJustin, I think the answer is obvious, just huge volumes of homework, wouldn't that be cool?\nAnderson:\nRight. Right. Right. Right. Well, we have time for one more question and I'm going to go back to the cool guy, Neal, with a question about digital tracing. So, we've talked a lot about digital tracing and cell phones. What does that actually mean? How do you do that successfully? What are the options for digital tracing?\nKatyal:\nLet me give you an example, Dr. Kim gave me and some others. So, everyone has to download this app on their phone, and you bring the phone with you. And one person brought the phone to a bar in South Korea and came out of the bar and four days later got a notification that someone else in the bar, within 15 minutes of him being there tested positive for coronavirus. That person then went and got tested and turned out the low and behold, he was along with I think 59 other people from that one person who walked into a bar who had coronavirus.\nBut they were able to take those 59 people and then isolate them and quarantine them for 14 days, reducing the further spread. I think there was a little bit of spread after that, but I think it was under 200 total cases. They compared that to another situation in which the digital tracing didn't work, that another nightclub and one person actually resulted in at least 6,000 cases that they knew of. So, by using this technology and I understand people are worried in this country, in any country about giving that information or allowing, enabling an app like that. And it could be abused in all sorts of ways.\nBut again, it's a pretty different thing from a government doing it and a private entity like Dartmouth doing it. Particularly if, as I understand from my conversations with the provost, they're committed to that information being anonymized and restricted to really only those who need to know it for an absolute community health rationale.\nAnderson:\nThank you for that, Neal. And thank you to both you and Joanne for taking the time to join us today. That was really interesting and quite helpful. So, thanks a lot for joining community conversations. Joe, before I go back to you, I just want to comment on a question we got about the Monday announcement and whether or not it would be in the form of a community conversation or in the form of an email? I just want folks to know that it will be a message to the community that will be delivered over email. There will not be a community conversation on Monday, but (in) future community conversations I'm sure we'll be dealing with the fall and the year that follows. So, we look forward to those conversations. So, Joe, I'm going to go back to you.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thank you, Justin. And that's absolutely right. We will take a pause, I believe, next week in the community conversation to give people time to formulate questions associated with the written announcement that will go out Monday, which is going to be highly detailed. We anticipate being back on Wednesday, July 8, to continue the conversation. So, thank you again, Justin, for moderating and for relaying such helpful and insightful questions. Thank you to our guests, Joanne Conroy and Neal Katyal for a great discussion about both work in your sphere and some of the broader issues that are so important to us as we lead up to this announcement and move forward to reopening Dartmouth to undergraduate students in the fall.\nI have to say, I'd like to close just with something you said, Neal, right at the end. What gives me hope and encouragement is this shared sense of community and the respect for one another, that Dartmouth, Dartmouth students, Dartmouth staff, Dartmouth faculty, and the local community share. That leaves me excited by the challenge in front of us and the opportunity to reassemble the academic community here in Hanover this fall. So, thanks to everyone. We look forward to sharing the announcement with you on Monday. Keep the questions coming and we will look forward to being back with you again for another community conversation soon. Take care, be safe, and have a good week everyone.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/community-conversations-june-24-2020-transcript"},
{"title": "March 16, 2020, Update", "text": "March 16, 2020, Update\nTo the Dartmouth community,\nThis morning, our COVID-19 task force co-chairs informed the campus that three members of the Dartmouth community were being tested for COVID-19. This evening, I am writing to confirm that one of these students, a graduate student residing in off-campus housing, has been confirmed to be presumptive positive, indicating that the disease has now been found in the Dartmouth community. We have been in touch with this person and their roommate to make sure they are comfortable and that they have everything they need while the person who tested positive recovers.\nAs stated earlier, the students undergoing testing are following protocol by staying in their homes and will be working with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to determine if any other close contacts also need to quarantine.\nThe transmission path of this latest case is following the expected trajectory of the disease, with more members of our community expected to become infected over time. There remain, however, steps we can and should take to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Whether you are young or old, and regardless of how well you feel, there are actions we must take that put the community first. Please make the modest personal sacrifice of remaining at home whenever possible and avoiding parties and other social gatherings. We can help to slow the spread of this virus and protect our friends, families, and neighbors if we limit our physical interaction and continue to practice good hygiene.\nEveryday steps that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, include washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nWe are monitoring unfolding events and are in close contact with state and federal health authorities. We will keep you informed regarding changing policies and information. Please check your email frequently over the next few days. I know that news reports can be discouraging, but please remember that we have the ability to slow the transmission of this virus by putting the safety of all members of our community first.\nSincerely,\nJoseph Helble, provost", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/community-messages/march-16-2020-update-0"},
{"title": "March 4, 2020, Update", "text": "March 4, 2020, Update\nTo the Dartmouth community,\nWe write to update you about our response to the COVID-19 coronavirus on campus and to urge you to visit dartmouth.edu/covid19, which is updated frequently with the latest guidance and resources.\nDARTMOUTH CONTACTS WITH DHMC EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVELY FOR COVID-19\nEarlier this week we learned that a number of Tuck students had attended a social event at The Engine Room in White River Junction on Friday, February 28, with a Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center employee who was subsequently confirmed to have tested positively for COVID-19.\nAll of those Tuck students, who have been notified of this fact, were deemed to be at low risk by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) because they were believed not to have had any direct contact with the employee. Individuals who have been identified as having potential direct contact with the employee are being required to stay at home in self-quarantine for a period of up to 14 days.\nNo limits were placed on their activities, but out of an abundance of caution, they were asked to follow NHDHHS guidelines for self-observation.\nYesterday, a second D-H employee tested positively for COVID-19 and is now being appropriately isolated. Four Geisel School of Medicine students were identified as close contacts to this second individual and are being monitored by NHDHHS. The Geisel students have been self-quarantined and Dartmouth is working with the impacted students to find suitable housing accommodations.\nINTERNATIONAL TRAVEL GUIDANCE AND POLICIES\nShort-Term Travel Scheduled for March:\nEffective March 4, 2020, Dartmouth is canceling student international programming such as spring break programs, internships, and field-based research, and discourages any international individual travel for all members of the Dartmouth Community. Given the quickly evolving nature of COVID-19, there are serious risks of travel disruptions as well as potential exposure to COVID-19. Those who choose to travel internationally and return from or transit through a country that is rated as a CDC Level 2 or Level 3 based on COVID-19 risk will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, and those returning from a CDC Level 1 will be required to self-observe for 14 days before returning to campus. To be clear, self-quarantine for travel that commenced after March 4, 2020, will need to occur off campus.\nLong-Term Travel:\nFor longer term travel, such as spring term international study programs and internships, Dartmouth is still evaluating the situation and will provide more detailed updates later this week. Until such time, Dartmouth discourages commencing any travel to countries rated CDC Levels 1-3 due to COVID-19 risk. Domestic travel programs are not impacted at this time.\nPlease visit news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/important-updates for information regarding self-quarantine and self-observation.\nCAMPUS EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES\nIn accordance with guidance from the CDC and NHDHHS, Dartmouth is not prohibiting public events or activities at this time; however, event organizers should make appropriate decisions relative to their event in determining whether to cancel or proceed. We recommend that those who are holding events include timely reminders about maintaining good hygiene such as washing hands, avoiding handshakes, and reminding individuals with possible symptoms that they should remain at home.\nSPRING TERM PROGRAMS AND CLASSES\nDartmouth is planning to hold spring term classes on campus. We are also preparing contingency plans to ensure business and learning continuity in the event that circumstances change unexpectedly.\nThere has been a lot of media coverage, social media discussion, and communications regarding COVID-19 across the Upper Valley and our campus. Some of what you are hearing and seeing may be inaccurate or incomplete. We will continue to update you via email as necessary and urge you to visit dartmouth.edu/covid19 when you have questions.\nWe understand that this is a stressful time for many people on campus, particularly those who may be at higher risk or who have friends and relatives living in affected countries. We will be in touch with the community regularly with additional updates, planning information, and guidance for protecting your health.\nSincerely,\nLisa Adams, MD\nJoshua Keniston\nCo-Chairs, Dartmouth COVID-19 Task Force", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/community-messages/march-4-2020-update"},
{"title": "Community Conversations, May 6, 2020 Transcript", "text": "May 6, 2020 Transcript\nJoseph Helble:\nWelcome, everyone to our second Dartmouth Community Conversation addressing our planning response and operations in the time of COVID-19. I'm Joe Helble. I'm the provost of Dartmouth College and as I did last week, I'm joining you from the Star Instructional Studio on a very quiet Dartmouth College campus in Hanover, N.H. I'll be joined in our discussion this afternoon by Justin Anderson, our vice president for communications who will be with us from another studio here on campus and also, by three members of the Dartmouth faculty teaching three different groups of students in three different parts of the curriculum. We'll be joined by Cecilia Gaposchkin, who is a professor of history, the incoming department chair of the history department and who for the past 16 years, has been the director of undergraduate advising at Dartmouth and therefore, in many different ways, touching the lives of every single one of our undergraduate students in that time.\nShe'll be joined by professor Petra Bonfert-Taylor, who is a professor of engineering at the Thayer School of Engineering, a mathematician by background and training and who has been for the past several years, the director of the Dartmouth Emerging Engineers program to help encourage students from the full range of the Dartmouth campus to consider engineering as a professional, academic and career opportunity. And finally, we'll be joined by professor John Lynch, the former four-term governor of New Hampshire, former corporate CEO and since 2013, a member of the Tuck School of Business faculty teaching a course on leadership in the public and private sector.\nOur format today will be the same as the format last week and in fact, the same as the format every week in our community conversations. I'll start by providing a brief update on some of the decision making that's been taking place on campus over the course of the past week and also, some insight into the issues we'll be wrestling with over the course of the next seven days. We'll take about 10 to 15 minutes to walk through some of those issues and then I will take your questions and try and answer them live moderated by Justin Anderson, our VP for communications. Last week in our inaugural conversation in this series, we had a very engaged discussion. Nearly 80 of you submitted questions over the course of the hour and I'm looking forward to a similarly stimulating exchange this afternoon with both me and with our faculty joining us today.\nOur goal here is to amplify what's in the written communications that the task force and president Hanlon and I are putting out to campus describing our decision making process, provide an update as I said on what we're working on and again, answer your questions as best as we possibly can. Last week, I spent some time describing the process that led to our summer term decision-making announced about a week and a half ago. We also spent some time speaking about the early planning for fall term and the process that we would use to make decisions around academic activities in the fall term. Those processes were amplified in the campus message that president Hanlon and I sent out to the campus two days ago on Monday of this week articulating a June 29 deadline for announcing our plans for education at the undergraduate level in the fall quarter of 2020.\nIn all of these, I mentioned last week and I think it bears repeating today that we are being guided by our core fundamental principles. From the beginning, the safety of the extended community, the Dartmouth community and the Upper Valley community has been our number one priority. It is students returning to campus. It is students living in our residence halls. It is students engaging in their work on the campus. It is faculty and staff who are working with those students and supporting them in their educational and research adventures, and it is the community, the broader community that exists with us and around us in the Upper Valley and who interact frequently with those of us on the Dartmouth campus. It is the community health of that extended body that we are focused on first and foremost and guided by in our decision.\nOur second underlying and fundamental principle is to do everything we can to ensure the educational continuity of the programs for our students. Graduate and undergraduate alike, research and teaching alike. It is your classroom education, it is your independent study, it is your scholarly pursuit and it is your progress towards your degree, your education and your career goals that motivates our thinking and our decision process. Well, last week as I said and in the campus message that we released on Monday of this week, we announced that June 29 was the date by which we would outline our plans for the fall term. In reaching those decisions, we have three working groups or task forces that are helping us address various aspects of the challenge that need to be considered in moving forward.\nThere's an academic working group consisting of the deans and associate deans of the schools with undergraduate students, so that would be the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the faculty of the Thayer School of Engineering, working with the relevant faculty committees in each of those schools on curricular issues, helping us think about how we teach our courses, what the right mix between remote teaching and learning and on-campus learning can be and must be once we have a sense of the number of students we can safely and responsibly accommodate here on campus in a residential community this fall and helping us then make decisions that will enable course registration to take place over the course of the month of July and prepare students for the beginning of the fall 2020 academic term.\nThere is a health working group, which I also announced last week and which was mentioned in the message that president Hanlon and I sent out on Monday, that's a collaboration or a partnership between our colleagues at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and senior staff colleagues here on the Dartmouth College campus asking questions that will enable us to safely bring the maximum number of students back to campus. How do we think about testing and monitoring? How do we think about contact tracing? How do we think about preparing our facilities for isolation and quarantine. How do we help support the healthcare of students and faculty and staff, community members who may become ill with COVID-19 over the course of the academic year?\nThen finally, our existing task force that's been operating since early January will provide input, focus and recommendations on operational decisions that we need to make to support the academic program and to support the recommendations of the health care working group. Those groups are all operating in concert with one another and we anticipate, again, being in a position to announce our decision based on input from all of those groups by the end of June. Now, all of these operational decisions have budgetary implications. For spring 2020, I have mentioned and we have mentioned openly and statements that we have made at various venues on campus and in documents we have sent out to the campus, that we like all of higher education are facing a budgetary challenge in spring 2020 and beyond associated with our response to COVID-19.\nWe have said openly that our operations are anticipated to lose $50 million over the course of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 alone. In addition, we are projecting an additional $20 to $30 million in working capital losses. In addition, we are projecting a potential $10 million in operating losses over the course of the summer 2020 quarter now that that quarter will be taught through remote learning. We have made adjustments already to try and address this budgetary shortfall. We have announced that there is a hiring freeze on all staff positions through the end of December of 2020, a hiring freeze that may, if needed, be extended beyond the end of the calendar year.\nWe have announced that staff and faculty wages will be frozen at their current levels for the upcoming fiscal year for 2021. We have asked all of our leaders to reduce their spending on non-compensation items in the fourth quarter of 2021 to generate some immediate savings. We have indicated and announced that we will use all of a revenue stabilization reserve that was set up by president Hanlon when he arrived as president seven years ago to help buffer some of the impact in uncertain budgetary times such as these. Those will help get us partway towards addressing the budgetary challenge, but they will not get us all the way to addressing the budgetary challenge.\nSo over the course of the next several weeks to a month, I and the executive vice president for finance and administration, Rick Mills, and our chief financial officer, Mike Wagner, will be meeting with and working with the leaders of different schools in divisions to outline budgetary adjustments that will need to be made in many of the units across campus in the upcoming fiscal year. Those will help us weather the short term storm, and then we will begin the process of working towards FY '22 and beyond budgets over the course of the summer. How will we get there? Well, we won't be doing this work in isolation. We have several committees of faculty and staff and senior leaders who will be providing critique, asking difficult, challenging, and important questions and providing input that will help inform our decision making as we go along.\nFirst and foremost will be the Dartmouth Budget Committee, which consists of deans, associate deans, vice presidents, budgetary faculty committee chairs from all of the schools where such committees exist and school fiscal officers who meet monthly and have been meeting monthly for a period of several years to help us work through longterm questions associated with the Dartmouth operating budget in both good times and in challenging times. We will continue to meet with different faculty groups across campus, including first and foremost in arts and sciences, the Committee on Priorities, which has historically been deeply engaged in helping the dean of the faculty of Arts and Sciences and the university leadership ask questions about budgetary priorities on campus, particularly as they impact our largest faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and its programs.\nIn addition, we have recently formed a new group, which we are referring to as a council on priorities; a short term council focused on budgetary priorities for this period of time only that draws non-administrative faculty leaders from all four of the faculty bearing schools across campus from arts and sciences, from the Tuck School of Business, from the Thayer School of Engineering or from the Geisel School of Medicine, not to represent their schools in the process, but to bring the perspective of their schools to a conversation that helps us ask and hopefully answer questions related to budgetary decisions that we all need to make that are in the collective longterm interests of the Dartmouth educational and research experience. So there will be more to come on each of those fronts, more to come from each of those groups, more to relate from each of those conversations in the weeks and in the month ahead.\nThose decisions will of course, be informed as well by decisions and input from the president's senior leadership group, which consists of the deans and the vice presidents from across campus and of course, from president Hanlon himself as we work through these challenging budgetary questions and make adjustments to budgets as necessary for FY '21 and potentially beyond. I won't sugar coat this. The challenge that we face is not just the immediate, but it's the uncertainty that lies ahead of us in the next fiscal year and beyond. What will the academic year look like? How many students will we be able to bring back to residential education on campus? How many students will in fact, choose to take our classes through remote learning and residential education? What will the financial aid needs of our students be given these extraordinarily uncertain economic times?\nWe recognize that so many families' financial circumstances are changing and Dartmouth remains committed to meeting families full demonstrated financial need. What will that mean in terms of additional financial aid support that Dartmouth will need to generate and provide to support that fundamental commitment? Of course, we know that a large part of our operating budget is supported by both earnings on the endowment and by the generous contributions of our alumni and friends through the Dartmouth College Fund and the various schools' annual funds. It is impossible to forecast at this moment in time, what philanthropic giving will look like during the course of the next fiscal year and that does have significant potential impact on our budgets in FY '21 and beyond.\nSo as we think about that and those ongoing conversations, let me just return briefly to an update on some of the near term decisions that I announced next week that were in process being worked through with the task force and other committees and that will be announced in the near term. Last week, I said that we had a group within the task force that was working on the question of returning student belongings to students scattered across the country in the world, belongings that had been left behind when our students needed to return to their homes at the start of spring break. We anticipate making an announcement on the process to reconnect students with their belongings by the middle to end of next week.\nGrading, I know, is a question that remains on everyone's minds and I will again reaffirm the decision that summer term we'll be offering a graded experience in all of our courses. The faculty committees continue to discuss the possibility of an expanded NRO or looking at other ways that grading may be offered over the course of the summer term. Details on that we anticipate announcing also within the next week to week and a half. Finally, the next near term decision that needs to be made and announced is the form and structure of what I am calling the June virtual ceremony, a ceremony to recognize [inaudible] ... virtual ceremony, a ceremony to recognize award and confer degrees to our graduating students. Details on that will also be released in the next one to two weeks.\nFinally in the area of research, the next major series of decisions and recommendations and announcements will center around what I have referred to as the gradual, controlled and measured reopening of the on-campus research activity and experience over the course of the summer. First and foremost, let me say research has not stopped. I have been asked from time to time if the campus has been shut down and research activity has been closed. That is absolutely not the case.\nResearch has been continuing in different ways through remote venues, through data analysis, people working at home, through writing of scholarly manuscripts, through writing of grant proposals. The research activity at its fundamental core has been continued. But we recognize that there is laboratory work and on-campus work that needs to be done for research to progress in the ways that it is designed to progress. Over the course of the summer, we are going to begin to release some of the restrictions and enable some of our researchers to slowly begin returning to campus under very controlled, monitored and managed circumstances.\nTo give you a sense of how vibrant the research enterprise has remained, let me just take a moment to relay a series of conversations I had yesterday morning. I was invited by the dean of the medical school, Dwayne Compton, to join the chairs of the foundational science departments in Geisel for a discussion around research activity, teaching, budgetary questions, and our operations in this moment of COVID-19, particularly as they pertain to graduate research activity and the activity of the medical school.\nThe conversation and what I learned from each of those chairs in terms of activity that's creatively continuing in their programs is just phenomenal. I learned from the head of the Micro and Immuno Department of his work, David Leib's work on developing rapid COVID-19 diagnostics. I learned from the head of the Epidemiology Department, Margaret Karagas, about undergraduate students in this time of disruption remaining engaged by working with faculty to develop and provide realtime evidence-based responses to global partners of the Dartmouth Center for Health Equity about time-sensitive questions related to the current pandemic in their countries.\nI learned from the new head of Molecular and Systems Biology who has been with us for just a few months. She recognized early on in her tenure as department chair, as she said, \"Famous scientists are sitting around at home confined to working out of their home as well. They're available. Why not tap them and bring them into our campus as guest speakers for a seminar series?\" She started one up and she's now getting 70 participants routinely engaging in conversation with some of the country's leading scientists in her area.\nI learned from the head of the Biomedical Data Science Department a whole range of projects that students, including undergraduate students, are conducting from home under faculty guidance, some of them as part of their honors thesis. A great example of being a student who's developing AI tools for histological image analysis. The list goes on and on.\nI also learned from the head of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center that recently within the past few days, Dartmouth's Norris Cotton Cancer Center learned that it is one of only two National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers to receive multiple COVID-19 supplements to their core grant for doing research work to help address this epidemic.\nAre we closed to research? When I'm asked that question, the answer is emphatically no. But there is a clear desire and a clear need to return to the bench. Again, last week we said we would slowly begin to return over the summer. The vice provost for research is leading a working group that's developing plans. He sent out an email to principal investigators and members of the campus research community on Friday, followed by a message from the dean of the Guarini School, Jon Kull, to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers today outlining our plans to begin to ease restrictions incrementally starting in early June.\nIt will not be business as usual when our research community returns to campus. Research will be conducted only where it is needed and essential to be done on campus in a laboratory environment. There will be strict limits on the number of people who can be in a laboratory at any one time. There will be strict protocols, which will be followed including disinfection between stints of researchers in the labs. But the point is that we are now working forward with concrete proposals to return some research activity to campus. We anticipate announcing full details on that plan next week.\nLet me end by where I started with just a reminder of the first principles that are guiding our decisions and our response to COVID-19. First and foremost, community in the broadest possible sense, health and safety guiding everything that we do. Second, educational continuity for our community and particularly for our students in both research and teaching undergraduate and graduate.\nLet me finish with just a quick note on the teaching piece since the faculty will be joining me shortly. We'll be speaking about their teaching and their teaching creativity and innovation to give you some numbers. A few days ago, I asked the deans of each of our schools, graduate, professional and undergraduate arts and sciences faculty, to give me a sense of how many classes they had had scheduled to be offered during spring 2020 term before the pandemic upended operations and how many they eventually offered.\nThe Geisel School of Medicine, turns out they're offering every single class that had been on the books except for those that had a required clinical component. Everything in the MD and MPH curriculum except for those that had a required clinical component is being offered. Tuck School of Business, 42 out of 42 classes are being offered. Guarini School of Graduate Advanced Studies, every class being offered. Thayer in arts and sciences, only a handful of classes were canceled, only those needing specialized equipment or labs. Even many of those, particularly in engineering, have gone forward. In fact, one half of the engineering courses being offered this term by remote learning have a group project, a design project or a lab component associated with them.\nIn total, 94% of our scheduled classes have been offered as planned. 674 in arts and sciences alone, 884 by my count across the campus. That is a transformation that happened in two weeks time from the point where we decided that spring term would be remote learning to the point where the term opened. This is an incredible commitment of our faculty and our staff to offering our students educational continuity and quality educational continuity.\nOur faculty will tell the story a little bit later this afternoon, but I will just end by simply saying I am extraordinarily proud of the way the Dartmouth community has responded and the numbers I think speak for themselves in terms of what they have brought to our students this term and what I fully expect and know they will bring to the classroom and the laboratory this summer.\nWith that, Justin, I'll turn to you to see if there are any questions from our audience before we turn back to our faculty guests and engage them in a conversation around teaching.\nJustin Anderson:\nThank you, Joe. Nice to see you today. In fact, the questions are coming in at a very fast pace. A lot of interest in the return to campus and when that will be and how it will happen. A lot of questions about the fall term specifically. I think this question sort of represents a lot of what I'm seeing. What are the considerations underway for exactly who will be allowed on campus in the fall?\nHelble:\nThat's a really good and important question. It's one I'm asked frequently, Justin. But before we can answer the who, we have to answer how many. The sequence is first take guidance from the healthcare working group, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Dartmouth collaborative partnership and the health and epidemiology working group that's part of our core task force and take their guidance in looking at our facilities in looking at the existence of testing capacity in the area or testing capacity that we could deploy in the area, looking at state and federal guidance and their Dartmouth-Hitchcock guidance around monitoring.\nThen looking at what it would take to have appropriately socially distant safe and secure students in our residence halls and have them use all of that information to give us a recommendation on the maximum number of students we can safely accommodate. Once we have that number, which we anticipate developing over roughly the course of the next month, then we need to think about mapping that against the curriculum and the different students who could potentially come back to campus. As you might imagine, that is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult process and difficult decision to make. Every student as a legitimate claim as to why he or she would benefit most from being here on campus this fall.\nMy hope is and would be that we can bring every student back to campus this fall, we have to acknowledge that for us and the vast majority of campuses in this country, that is not a likely outcome. We do expect to be operating in a hybrid mode. We do expect to be operating with less than full residential capacity in this fall. We do know that we have extraordinarily difficult considerations to weigh in making the decision as to who those students will be.\nAnderson:\nA related question, Joe, which I appreciate for its bluntness. What is the point in bringing back some students during fall term, but not all students? Isn't it either safe or not safe?\nHelble:\nThat's an interesting question. I don't think about it that way as safe or unsafe. I think about it as identifying the conditions under which the maximum number of students could be safe. To pick an extreme, you can imagine that one student running in the woods by him or herself right now is outdoors getting exercise and it's a perfectly safe environment. But 40,000 people pack together on the start line of the Boston Marathon is not a safe environment because of proximity and potential for transmission.\nBetween those two extremes, there is a number that through social distancing, through disinfection, through personal protective equipment, through constant testing and monitoring, the authorities believe, the public health authorities believe, and we believe that we can manage in a safe and secure environment. We don't want it to be an all-or-nothing decision. We do think that as extraordinarily well as online learning seems to be going, there is benefit to our students in being members of a collective resident and of a community. We would like to afford the opportunity to bring as many of them back to that experience as quickly as we possibly can, but we will not compromise their safety in doing that.\nAnderson:\nIn your open, Joe, you mentioned return to research activity at some point in the coming weeks. A couple of questions about the prioritization process around that and how we will determine the sequence in which departments will return.\nHelble:\nAll right. That won't be done on a department by department basis. Justin, the return will be governed on a school by school basis. There are committees in place in each school led by the dean in each school and working with appropriate research governance in each school that will review applications or requests and determine which labs are able to open when.\nIt will be governed largely by either the potential harm to samples if they are not able to return to campus and take care of their samples, whether these are biological samples or particularly fragile samples, ice cores for example, that may have a finite lifetime and need to be attended to. Or by the absolute requirement that on-campus, in situ laboratory work be done for research progress to continue. It will be a prioritization process governed by those with scientific expertise in each area. Then within each laboratory when a PI is given the ability to begin bringing students back, she or he will be in a position to determine who comes back when.\nIt won't be all or nothing. We can imagine easily staging students so that at different points in the day, different students have access. You can easily imagine instead of coming into the laboratory for eight or 10 or 12 hours, you come into the laboratory for two or three hours to do an experiment and then you return home to do a data analysis effort for the rest of the day while another student comes in and runs his or her experimental protocols. These are the kinds of decisions that the deans and the local leadership and then the PIs themselves will be making.\nAnderson:\nIn addition to interest in the eventual return and the sequence of that return, there's also a fair amount of questions about Dartmouth finances. Question, how much is in the budgetary reserve that you mentioned? How was it funded? What are ways that department needs can save further beyond compensation savings?\nHelble:\nSeveral good questions embedded in there. The short answers are the resource stabilization reserve was funded over time by growth in the working capital pool. This year we are seeing losses in the working capital pool. Those therefore need to draw on that resource stabilization reserve for part of the step we need to take to balance the operating losses and the working capital losses in Q4 of FY20.\nThe process for ... That the process for taking steps to make other budgetary adjustments, we recognize that a lot of our costs are in personnel, but we want to be in a position where we give individual school and unit leaders flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of their program, consistent with a fiscal target that they need to reach. And so, what does that mean? Well, rather than saying to any one individual, that staffing must be adjusted or a program must be closed, or that you must stop all non-compensation spending. We want to give the local leadership, school leadership, division leadership the ability to step back, look at their most important near term needs, and make decisions consistent with institutional guidance and principles, to achieve their budgetary goals.\nAnderson:\nA number of questions, Joe, about summer term and grading. This one asks, \"Why was the decision made to move to letter grades in the summer term from credit-no credit in the spring, when the format and method of delivery remain the same?\"\nHelble:\nRight. That's a good question, and the reason we made the decision to move to credit-no credit in the spring, after lengthy discussion involving the faculty across both arts and sciences and Thayer, was that the transition was so abrupt and students were going home to such a range of unknown circumstances. Technological access was uncertain. The ability of the faculty to deliver their content and engage their students in deep discussion remotely, was an unknown. And we felt that at that point in time, it was in the clear best interest of the students to give them an opportunity, given the suddenness of the change, to focus on the core of their learning and not worry about how things might be graded.\nWe also recognize the importance of grading and evaluation, and at that point in time, felt it was important to say, unequivocally, that by summer term we would return to a graded experience. The goal being to learn from our experience over the course of spring term, and be in a position to offer a fully graded experience in summer term. Perhaps with some flexibility, like an expanded NRO, non-recording option. That is exactly the question the faculty are debating now. Grades matter. We know that grades matter. We also want to be in a position where we can provide grades that are based on an ability to truly evaluate student work, after they and the faculty have had this term to adjust to remote learning.\nNow one of the things I said last week, and it remains true, is that our calendar has actually given us certain advantages, whereas most institutions face disruption in the middle of a semester in sending students home. We had to adapt rapidly, but we were right at the start of spring term. And we will, by the end of this month, have had the experience of a complete term, start to finish, know what works well, know where the opportunities lie to improve. We can take that experience and then layer grading upon that, on top of that over the course of the summer. And that's the goal of the faculty, that's the goal of the faculty leadership.\nAnderson:\nJoe, we have time for one more question, so that you can move on to your conversation with the faculty. This one is about summer. What are the options for students to change their D-plans? Particularly, is there an option to remove the summer residency requirement for the class of '22?\nHelble:\nRight. When we announced that summer term would be a residential term, we did indicate that students had the flexibility to change their summer term to summer of 2021, if they preferred to have the in-person experience a year from now, rather than a virtual remote experience this summer. We have not, at this point in time, adjusted the summer residency experience. There is still an expectation, as of this moment, that students will engage in a single residential summer term, as part of the Dartmouth experience.\nSo thank you, Justin. Thank you all for the questions and the engagement, and I'd now like to turn to our three faculty guests whom I mentioned at the very beginning. I think they will appear on screen shortly, in front of you and in front of me, hopefully, as well. Our three faculty colleagues are Cecilia Gaposchkin, professor and incoming chair of history, Petra Bonfert-Taylor, professor of engineering and head of the Dartmouth Emerging Engineers program, and John Lynch, former corporate CEO, former four term governor of New Hampshire, and for the past seven years, a professor at the Tuck School of Business. Welcome to all of you.\nSo I'd like to start by just putting a brief high level question to each of you, and ask if you could just briefly give us all an overview of the course you're teaching this term, your objective, your learning goals, anything you've had to do to adopt your remote learning format. And Cecilia, I'd like to start with you and then I'll turn to Petra and then to John. Cecilia?\nCecilia Gaposchkin:\nSure. Sure, Joe. Thanks for inviting me here. I'm this term teaching a first year seminar on Joan of Arc. The first year seminar program is run across the college, in different departments across the college and every first year student is supposed to, is required to take one. And they're designed for students to have an opportunity to work within the disciplines, particularly on writing and research. So, bringing students into college level expectations and training about academic writing and academic research. And I've taught the Joan of Arc seminar a number of times.\nIt's Joan of Arc is this remarkable 15th century woman, peasant woman who took on an army and led France to victory during the Hundred Years' War, and ended up being tried and executed for heresy. So kind of remarkable story, which is a wonderful sort of historical nugget to work with, with a bunch of students. And I found appeals to first year students, because she was 17, 18, 19 years old during her extraordinary but brief career in the 15th century. And so, that's the seminar. I don't know, would you like me to talk a bit about right now, about the adaptation or shall we ...\nHelble:\nRight, so just very briefly answer this as a yes or no question, and ... back to it. Is it different this term?\nGaposchkin:\nOh, yes and no. It's a different experience. The students are every bit as wonderful and every bit as engaged, but we've had to figure out how to do our work. And particularly the discussion, and community building and exchange component that normally comes in a 16 person seminar. These are small classes designed to function around discussion and the exploration of ideas, and having been recommended to go asynchronous for all the issues of access and internet and time zones. We've had to figure out new ways of engaging in that community discussion.\nHelble:\nGreat, so let's hold that thought. I want to come back to it and speak about specifically how you're engaging with students. So, Petra, how about you? Tell us about how you're teaching a relatively large group of engineering students, in an introductory class in this new format.\nPetra Bonfert-Taylor:\nYeah. Thank you for asking, Joe. The class I teach is introduction to scientific computing, which is an introduction to programming in two languages that are really important for engineers. Namely, C and math language. So two difficult languages that are very different from each other. It's a required class off the engineering majors, and they get about 60% freshmen and then 40% that makes up others in that class during spring term. And the way I run the class, is I have students watch brief introductory videos before class, interspersed with formative quizzes to make sure the students understand and follow the videos, and which leaves us time for programming exercises in my synchronous class meetings.\nThat way we can support students in real time, where they need my support the most. We've developed our own tools that allow barrier free coding on day one of the class. So rather than having to go through complicated installation procedures, students on that first day in class with me, right there, right their first programs. I use breakout rooms now in this online format, with fixed student groups. So I send students into breakout rooms to work on coding assignments, in small groups supported by wonderful learning fellows. These are students who've taken the class previously, and do now support the learning in class.\nSo in these breakout rooms, students work on programming problems, submit their solutions, so I can see what's what's going on in their groups. And I call them back to the main room, I go over one group's solution. We briefly go over some new concepts. I use an in class response system to gauge understanding, and then we repeat the whole process. And I'm supported in this with an absolutely fantastic team of teaching assistants and learning fellows, who constantly help me brainstorm and develop solutions to new situations and problems that occur.\nHelble:\nRight, so let me just ask you one very quick follow up action, give me a question, a very brief answer. Why did you choose to use fixed groups rather than variable?\nBonfert-Taylor:\nSo our research actually shows that having students work with the same groups is more beneficial for their learning, and I especially chose it this term, because I wanted students to be able to connect to one another. In a class of 50 students, I have two sections, each of which has 50 students. In a large class, students can not really get to know each other easily over Zoom, and I wanted to provide a social component and allow students to have this extra network of students to whom they could reach out if they're having problems, be it in class or problems outside of class, students who they really get to know. But there's also research reasons behind it, that support fixed groups over flexible groups.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thanks. Thank you very much. So, John, I'd like to turn to you now. You're teaching students who are slightly older. These are second year MBA students, as I understand it, taking an elective class focused on leadership. What an extraordinary opportunity in this moment in time. Tell us a bit about the class and how you go about engaging students through this mediated electronic format.\nJohn Lynch:\nWell, Joe, again, thank you for having all of us here. I teach a course called the CEO experience, the differences and similarities between being CEO in the private sector and CEO in the public sector, looking at the leadership styles and leadership qualities. So for example, we do Jim Kilts and the turnaround of Gillette; Harvey Golub, the turnaround of American Express; Knoll, the company which I ran. We also do, what was the turnaround of United Way? And Brian Gallagher, the CEO of United Way Worldwide, actually comes to class. We do the founding of Keurig, and the Keurig founders come to class.\nBut we also look at the public sector. We look at Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs, Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, the lack of leadership with respect to Hurricane Katrina. In terms of my class, I have 65 students in each of two sections, and we do exclusively the case method, which is all classroom discussion. And my goal for the course, is at the end I want the students to feel like they have the qualities and the confidence to be able to run any organization of any size, in the private sector or the public sector.\nHelble:\nSo John, if you don't mind my following up on that, the case method is an interesting approach to take to this particular medium. And one of the things you're looking for, is vigorous debate and exchange with the students. Zoom is a tough way to manage that. I think we've all sat in front of a Zoom meeting where we said something that we thought might be funny, and you're greeted by a sea of faces with muted microphones and it's hard to tell if you've connected. How do you engage the students in vigorous debate and discussion over Zoom?\nLynch:\nIt's incredibly interactive. I do it a number of ways. I cold call students. So I see the gallery of all the students and I call on them, and I do it and I tell them I'm not calling on them to see if they've read the case. I call on them, because I want them to participate in the discussion. I'll also ask for volunteers. When students say something different than somebody else might say, I get them talking with each other, debating the principle that is being discussed. I also, Joe, do a lot of role playing in my class, and I also do breakout groups. But, I do them randomly and I do them in part, because the students all know each other, Tuck being such a small school, and they've then gone through the first year together.\nHelble:\nAll right, thank you. So it's an interesting contrast to what Petra was saying, about having pre-assigned breakout groups a minute ago. But I think to me at least, the takeaway message that I think about, and as our faculty might think about as we think about teaching the summer term, is in one case you've got students who are brand new and don't know one another at all, and you're looking to build those relationships and give them an anchor.\nIn your case, John, you've got students who've been in the program for a year and a half and they're also at a different stage in their lives. And so, there's the opportunity to push them a bit more outside their comfort zone. So, thank you. I hadn't thought about that. Cecilia, I wanted to come back to you for the next question. I'm intrigued you're teaching a writing course, a writing course where I understand, from our conversations previously, you have students engaging in a collaborative group based writing project. Tell us about that briefly, and tell us how you're evaluating student writing.\nGaposchkin:\nWell sure, Joe. The answer is two fold. The first answer is that, or the first one set of assignments is exactly the way I would have done it in any other class, which is to say, they have a series of essays that they write based on primary sources that we've read. It's the basic building block of history, and they learn to draw information, and make arguments and offer historical interpretations. And I tell them a bit about how this works, and they do papers, and I mark them up on an iPad with a pencil. I send them the PDF back and then we conference about it, just the way I would if we were on campus, and then they rewrite it and I go through the whole thing again. In that sense, the individual assignments are designed exactly the way they would be in a regular term. But in order to engage group discussion in this asynchronous format, we are also engaging in a collective writing project of writing a book together, or rather I should say they are. Joan of arc is the figure in medieval history about whom we have the most sources, the ... materials, much of which has been translated. So, the idea of, through Google Docs, which is a wonderful online way of working on collaboration, we've put together an outline for a book on the life and legacy of Joan of Arc and in fixed groups, precisely in order, the way Petra was talking about, to foster sub groups and community and areas of discussion.\nThey are drafting, writing, debating their ideas in the written format, editing each other, trying to integrate the material of other groups, writing sections, trying to work out their interpretation of this extraordinary figure from the 15th century. It's the first time I've done it. It seemed like a mad gambit, but a really interesting project to try precisely because of the credit, no credit option. This term permitted me to do something a bit more creative or something that I've wanted to try for a long time, but without the anxiety on their part that the project design might result in a low grade for them. So, that's actually, for me, really been interesting to see them. ... It's remarkable, actually, to see the way in which they're participating and debating on it, and it's precisely because of the fact that it's credit, no credit that I'm able to experiment with this project, this group, term-long project of research and writing.\nHelble:\nDo you think this is something you might take as a project and bring back to your teaching on campus when we return to regular residential operation?\nGaposchkin:\nYeah, great question. I've been thinking a lot about that. My core goal for this term of the students was that they had a good learning experience and so, that's what I wanted. So, I didn't want to make it too challenging. I want it to be intellectually challenging but I didn't want them to worry about too many steps. I am learning so much about how to run this project. I certainly am glad for this opportunity to do this and learning both how to structure, how to intervene, when to give comments. This week, for instance, were scheduling, which is particularly difficult, group conferences with the groups about the portions that they've written and weighing in. I'm hoping... We'll see how the book comes out, but I think it's a great project and I would love to redo it or reimagine it, given what I've learned, for future terms.\nHelble:\nOkay, thank you. I love the creativity of the exercise. I really look forward to hearing about how it ends up at the end of the term, so let me know.\nGaposchkin:\nWe'll send you a copy of the book.\nHelble:\nThat would be great. I would love that. Please do send me a copy of the book. Thank you Cecilia. So in the interest of time, I think I'm just going to offer two more questions, one each for Petra and John, and then I want to make sure we have time to turn to our viewers and see if there are any questions coming in from our audience. So Petra, one of the things I wanted to ask you is Thayer is doing, as I know and as we've discussed, some really interesting and creative things in the laboratory and design space. You've not let the remote learning environment in any way reduce the hands-on component of student education, which I think is extraordinary. Can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing and how you've gone about that?\nBonfert-Taylor:\nYeah, it's absolutely remarkable and I don't want to make it sound like I'm doing this. This is really us as a Thayer community family doing all these remarkable and ingenious things. So, for example, within a time span of four days, we sent out 300 FedEx packages bringing the labs to the students rather than the students to the labs. Let me just give you some examples of what's going on in some of our classes.\nIn our Computer-Aided Machine and Mechanical Engineering Design class, for example, each student was sent a 3D printer and they're not as expensive as you think they are. The first assignment for the students was to print parts to modify the printer. Just imagine that, and then it goes from there. In our Digital Electronics class, which is a lab class, each student was sent a digital oscilloscope along with a programmable circuit board, let's put it that way. Students meet in small groups in that class to complete their lab assignments.In our Material Science class, students were sent kits, salt, rock candy, different types of materials, and they can also remotely control the slides on a microscope that's been set up here at Thayer. In our Intro to Engineering class, now you're going to be scared here, each student was sent a credit card, but don't worry. There was a spending limit on each of those cards.\nHelble:\nYeah. As the chief budget officer, my heart just skipped a beat when you said that. Thank you.\nBonfert-Taylor:\nDon't worry, we're on top of it. Students also remotely work with the machine shop. They meet with technical instructors and discuss the design of their projects, and then the technical instructors fabricate parts that the students need and ship them out to the students. All of our lab courses remain lab courses. All of our project-based courses remain project-based courses and all our small courses are remain small. All courses are supported by even more TAs than we normally supply for courses to really make this a fabulous learning experience for all of our students.\nHelble:\nThat's fabulous. Petra. I hope that you or Alexis or someone at Thayer will be writing up a nice summary of this at the end of the term because I think it's something that we can all learn from, and not just the Dartmouth community but the broader educational community that's grappling with the challenge of lab courses over remote learning, so thank you. Last question. I'd like to turn back to you, Gov. Lynch. John, through your extraordinary career, you obviously have much experience that's relevant to the kinds of issues your students are going to be grappling with in their careers, and so let me ask you in our final question, before we turn it to the audience, as a former four-term governor, you've ... . Leadership in all sectors is facing an extraordinary moment of challenge. How do you help your students learn from this and prepare for that inevitable moment that they will encounter in their careers?\nLynch:\nWell, Joe, we tell them that inevitably, as you say, they're going to be facing some kind of a crisis, whether they're working in the public sector or the private sector. Interestingly enough, many, if not all, of the qualities which we've already discussed and are discussing in our cases will be applicable to these crises and are applicable to how the coronavirus is being managed. The ability to communicate, to communicate well, be consistent. The importance of being available and accessible, building together a team which will work well together. All of these qualities, which we talk about in our cases, are so applicable to what we see or don't see today and what the students will have to do when that crisis faces them.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thank you John and thanks to all of you. Justin, we have about five minutes left in our hour and we'd like to turn it over to you to see if there are questions coming in from outside.\nAnderson:\nThanks Joe, and in fact there are. This question just came in actually. Petra, in reference to something you said, some of the teaching elements Petra spoke of are well-supported learning tools, i.e. formative quizzes. Historically, there's been a bit of pushback on using these as part of the course development. Might there be more interest in including these across the board even in a post-remote environment?\nBonfert-Taylor:\nI think that's a fantastic question and one I've actually thought about, I believe we've just made a leap ahead, something like a 10 year leap ahead, in our instructional strategies and in the learning we've all done about what works and what doesn't work in the classroom. We still have a lot of evaluation to do to really get the student voice into the picture and find out what works best for our students in all of these different situations, but I completely agree that we might make tremendous progress in many new ways to integrate novel ways of teaching into all of our classes, be it remote or on campus.\nAnderson:\nThank you. A question came in addressed to Gov. Lynch. What world leader in history, public or private sector, is your favorite model?\nLynch:\nWell, I'm currently reading a book on Winston Churchill, and he did an amazing job preparing England for World War II. So, because he's top of mind right now, I certainly would look toward him as somebody who embodies a lot of the leadership skills which I teach in my course.\nAnderson:\nI'm wondering, based on that, are you integrating the topic of COVID-19 into either your curriculum or into any of your assignments over the course of this remote term?\nLynch:\nWe do. We talk about coronavirus all the time and what various governors are doing. Who's doing it well, who isn't doing it well? What are the qualities that we think are reflective of great leadership? Gov. Cuomo comes to mind in terms of somebody who we all think is doing it well. So, it's constantly a subject which we refer to in the myriad of cases which we review and discuss.\nAnderson:\nThanks. I have time for one more question. First Cecilia, what kinds of, quote, tricks and techniques have you been implementing in the remote format to help keep the students engaged?\nGaposchkin:\nThere's two kinds of engagement. One is that, like Petra, I'm using more quizzes than I would normally because history is so often rooted really in reading sources. I've asked them to show their mastery, what they would normally do in class, through discussion board discussions, through our learning management system, Canvas, and through quizzes. I've tried to make myself as available as possible. We do, it's asynchronous in that there's no required time together, but I've tried to permit or rather schedule as many opportunities. There's one period on Friday at 3:30 when everybody seems to be available and then I open up for office hours and individual meetings and group meetings as much as possible for engagement. I find Zoom works fairly well for discussion with about five or six people and that's been pretty successful.\nAnderson:\nThanks Cecilia. That is about all we have time for. Before I go back to Joe, I just want to thank everyone for joining us and sending in your questions. We didn't get to all of them. Hopefully, we'll have time next week to get even more questions. In the meantime, please consult the COVID-19 websites for lots of information and resources. You can get to that off of the Dartmouth homepage, and please tune in next week. Joe.\nHelble:\nThank you Justin, and thanks again to professors Gaposchkin and Bonfert-Taylor and Gov. Lynch for joining us this afternoon. It's really great for me, it's a treat for me, to have a chance to hear a bit more about the teaching you're bringing to the remote classroom this term and the creative things you're doing to engage students in their learning. That's all for this afternoon. We'll convene again at 3:30 next Wednesday for our next in the series of community conversations, and I anticipate, given the work of the task force and the working groups over the next week, that we'll be in a position to comment in much more detail on some of the operational decisions that will be made and will be then announced over the course of the next two weeks. So until then, stay well and stay healthy everyone, and we look forward to joining you next Wednesday at 3:30. Thank you.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/community-conversations-may-6-2020-transcript"},
{"title": "Community Conversations: Adapting to Remote Teaching, Learning", "text": "Watch the May 6 Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and faculty guests Petra Bonfert-Taylor, Cecilia Gaposchkin, and John Lynch.\nStudents in Professor of History Cecilia Gaposchkin's first-year seminar on Joan of Arc are writing a book together\u2014remotely. In Professor of Engineering Petra Bonfert-Taylor's scientific computing class, students are writing programs\u2014in Zoom breakout sessions. Second-year Tuck students are questioning CEO guests\u2014online\u2014in former N.H. governor and Clinical Professor of Business John Lynch's course on the CEO experience.\nWhat faculty have done in a short time under difficult circumstances is remarkable, said Provost Joseph Helble.\nIn this week's Community Conversations broadcast\u2014a weekly online forum for members of the Dartmouth community to ask questions and get updates from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014Helble spoke with Gaposchkin, Bonfert-Taylor, and Lynch about how they and their students are adapting to teaching and learning remotely this term.\nThe three professors gave viewers a window into the creativity and resilience being demonstrated by Dartmouth faculty, students, and staff throughout the institution during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\"In total, 94 percent of our scheduled classes have been offered as planned \u2026 884 by my count across the campus\u2014a transformation that happened in two weeks' time, from the point where we decided that spring term would be remote learning to the point where the term opened,\" Helble said. \"This is an incredible commitment of our faculty and our staff to offering our students quality educational continuity.\"\nHelble began Wednesday's session with an update on several ongoing issues, including the process by which student belongings left on campus at the end of winter term will be returned to their owners (he expects an announcement on this process by the end of next week); summer-term grading and the possibility of an expanded non-recording option for summer remote courses; the June virtual ceremony in which degrees will be conferred; plans to ramp up research on campus over the course of the summer; and the process for determining how many students, faculty, and staff may be able to safely return to campus for the coming fall term, which will likely be a combination of remote and residential learning.\nThe core principles guiding these and other critical decisions are \"first and foremost, community in the broadest possible sense\u2014health and safety guiding everything that we do,\" Helble said. \"And second, educational continuity for our community and particularly for our students in both research and teaching, undergraduate and graduate.\"\nHe addressed the financial losses that have led to wage and hiring freezes across the institution. \"I won't sugarcoat this: The challenge that we face is not just the immediate, but it's the uncertainty that lies ahead of us in the next fiscal year and beyond.\"\nHelble took questions from viewers on several of these issues, in a discussion moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to Starr Studio, where Helble was located.\nGaposchkin, Bonfert-Taylor, and Lynch joined Helble via Zoom from other locations. Each spoke about the challenges of remote teaching\u2014and what they've learned in the process.\nGaposchkin said she had wanted to try a group writing project in her Joan of Arc class for a long time, and the circumstances of this spring term have given her and her students the freedom to experiment.\n\"My core goal for this term for the students was that they had a good learning experience,\" she said. \"And I am learning so much about how to run this project.\"\nBonfert-Taylor spoke about how Thayer faculty and students are continuing lab- and project-based work remotely.\n\"We're bringing the labs to the students rather than the students to the labs,\" she said. In the four days before the start of spring term, 300 packages with specialized equipment, including items such as 3D printers and digital oscilloscopes, were sent to students' homes.\nAsked how he is incorporating the lessons of COVID-19 into his leadership course, Lynch said he tells students that \"they will face some kind of a crisis, whether they're working in the public sector or private sector. And many if not all of the qualities we are discussing in our cases will be applicable to these crises\u2014and are applicable to how the coronavirus is being managed.\"\nHelble said that while faculty are working remotely, they are continuing with research, doing data analysis, and writing scholarly manuscripts and grant proposals.\n\"Are we closed to research? When I'm asked that question, the answer is emphatically no,\" he said. \"The research activity at its fundamental core has been continued.\"\nOn-campus research will be \"gradual, controlled, and measured\" over the summer, he said, with a working group developing plans for bringing researchers back to campus, and essential lab work done in an environment with strict protocols in place.\nStrict measures will also be in place when some number of students return to campus, he said. But before students can come back to Hanover, Helble said, senior leaders will receive guidance from a new health care working group, and other health professionals, on how many students can be safely accommodated, and will map that number against curriculum scheduling.\n\"As you might imagine, that is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult process and difficult decision to make.\"\nCommunity Conversations will air Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. through spring term. The first episode is available on the Community Conversations site, which includes call-in numbers for those who want to listen to the show without video.

{"title": "March 7, 2020, Update", "text": "March 7, 2020, Update\nAs many of us prepare to leave campus following the end of term, we'd like to remind everyone of our international and domestic travel guidelines.\nDartmouth continues to discourage all international travel for students, faculty, and staff, including conference attendance and research site visitation.\nThose who choose to travel internationally and return from or transit through a country that is rated as a CDC Level 2 or 3 will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, and those returning from a CDC Level 1 country will be required to self-observe for 14 days. To be clear, self-quarantine for travel that commenced after March 4, 2020 will need to occur off campus. Self-observation can occur on campus. Guidance on conducting self-quarantine and self-observation can be found in the \"important updates\" section.\nThe College currently has no restrictions on domestic travel but continues to monitor this situation daily as guidance from state and federal authorities is updated and travel disruptions evolve.\nThere are no confirmed cases of people with COVID-19 on campus at this time. Finals period for undergraduates this week, and on-campus spring classes for all students will be held as planned. This is a fluid situation and we will continue to update you regarding any changes to our operations or policies.\nOn a final note, we have made posters, fact sheets, and digital signage slides available in the \"communications resources\" section of the Dartmouth COVID-19 website.

{"title": "Community Conversations Transcript", "text": "April 29, 2020 Transcript\nKey points:\nJoseph Helble:\nWelcome everyone to our first community conversation, addressing Dartmouth's planning, response and operations in the time of COVID-19. I'm Joe Helble, I'm the Dartmouth College provost. And I'm joining you this afternoon from a nearly empty campus, sitting in a very quiet star instructional studio. It's great to have a chance to connect although, I will say personally, it's not nearly the same. Looking around at the campus today and seeing it nearly empty of students, empty of faculty and staff on a beautiful springtime day, it certainly doesn't feel quite right to me and I know it doesn't feel quite right to any of us, that the campus is certainly different. In our conversations this afternoon, I'm going to be joined by Justin Anderson who is our vice president for communications, who is sitting in another studio on campus.\nAnd our COVID-19 taskforce co-chairs, Josh Keniston, who is the interim VP for campus services, joining us from his home, and Lisa Adams, who is a professor of medicine at Geisel and MD, our associate dean for global health in the Geisel School of Medicine, a professor of medicine and a specialist in the care and treatment of the infectious TB, and Lisa is also joining us from her home in Norwich. Our format that ... Each week for these sessions, is going to be a brief update, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes, where I will walk through some of the decisions that were in the midst of making and talk about planning for the next set of decisions, that will affect operations and academic planning and academic operations on the campus in the weeks and months ahead. We'll then take live question and answer, that will be moderated by Justin Anderson.\nAnd then, turn to have a brief conversation with campus leaders in this case today, the taskforce co-chairs, Josh Keniston and Lisa Adams, and then we will turn to you the audience for any questions you'd like to put specifically to our guests, before I wrap up briefly with a few words at the end. Our goal in these campus communications, these campus conversations, is to amplify the messages that the taskforce co-chairs, that President Phil Hanlon and I have been putting out in our written communications, and again to give you an update on what's happening now on campus and at Dartmouth, and truly to do our best to answer the questions that we know are on everyone's mind.\nNow, the decision that we made most immediately that I trust nearly everyone has seen and is familiar with, is the decision we announced a week ago, Monday, around summer term, the transition to a full summer term of remote learning. What I'd like to do today is not go through that decision per se because I'm trusting that you're all familiar with the details, but speak a little bit about the process that led us to that decision, to help give everyone a sense of how we are beginning to think about the process leading to decisions around fall term. When we made the announcement of the summer term decision last Monday, I can tell you that my email inbox, President Hanlon's email inbox, Dean Lively's email box, the taskforce email inbox, and every other senior leader, immediately began receiving questions, appropriately, about what's next.\nWhat's the timeline for decisions that impact other operations this summer? What's the timeline for decisions about the fall term? What kinds of decisions are we contemplating for the fall term? And I anticipate today that many of you will have questions there. But as I said, let me start with summer and just take a few minutes to walk through the thinking that guided our decision making. Now, from the beginning as we've approached our decisions related to campus operations and Dartmouth operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have said, and I have said as clearly as I can, that our absolute first priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of the community. This means, the health, safety and wellbeing of our student community. It means, the health, safety and wellbeing of our campus faculty and staff community, and it also means the health, safety and wellbeing of the broader Upper Valley community that interacts with Dartmouth so directly on a daily basis.\nWe've also said, and I've also said, that paramount in this, is ensuring the educational continuity of our students. This is the educational continuity of students in the classroom, this is the educational continuity of students pursuing independent research projects, this is the educational continuity of undergraduate and graduate students alike across the entirety of the Dartmouth campus. And our goal and my goal in all of this, is to be in a position where guided by the taskforce, we are able to make and I am able to announce, operational decisions as early as we can, to provide certainty and guidance in the community, but to provide them as late as possible, to be as well informed as we can in making those decisions. And I recognize that those principles may seem inherently contradictory, but that's part of the challenge and so much of what we're wrestling with in planning our response to COVID-19. We recognize that so many members of our community are looking for certainty so they can be able to plan.\nBut we also recognize that the parameters in federal and state guidance are changing so rapidly that we don't want to make decisions that have tremendous operational impact and tremendous impact on our workers, on campus, our students, our faculty and staff, and the larger Upper Valley community, any sooner than we absolutely have to. So, what parameters are we thinking about as make decisions related to COVID-19? Well, first and foremost, we need to look at the rate of progression of the disease, in our local community, in the states of New Hampshire and Vermont, nationally and also internationally. Why do we need to be thinking about the progression of the disease beyond just the Upper Valley? Well, that's because Dartmouth draws a national and international community of scholars and students to our campus. And so, it's not just progression of the disease and the surrounding Upper Valley environment that's relevant, but it truly is the rate of infection and the rate of containment of the disease across the entire country, across the entire world.\nWe have to ask ourselves whether we have adequate supplies of personal protective equipment and adequate ability to test people who are infected or potentially infected or exposed, before making a decision that we can bring large numbers of students, faculty, and staff back to campus. We ask ourselves whether our ability to make operational decisions that would begin to reopen the campus, need to rely on unrealistic expectations of our students and our community. You can imagine if we said we can open the campus to students but it can be one student per building, you need to be fully gowned at all times, and you need to effectively be locked in your room and not interact with another human being, that's certainly not the Dartmouth experience we want to promote and that's not a realistic expectation to impose upon our students. We need to ask whether there is still a need in federal and state guidance, requiring self-quarantine of all individuals returning to our campus. And we take a look at what decisions our peers are making.\nAnd here I have to say, it's been extraordinarily how openly our Ivy League peers and other educational peers, and we, have been sharing information and planning together. We are all in this together as we try and figure out the best path forward, to bring students, bring staff, bring faculty and bring research activity and educational activity back to our campuses. Decisions our peers are making are informative, but they are not determinative. Because, each institution and certainly Dartmouth, in our rural environment in Northern New Hampshire, has some unique characteristics that have to be considered as part of the process. And finally, let me say that the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic downturn associated with all of the self-isolation, self-quarantine and self-restriction and cessation of travel and restriction of economic activity, have had on a higher end broadly and on Dartmouth, have to be part of our calculus.\nWe've said quite openly over the past few weeks that, our loss in the fourth quarter alone of fiscal year 2020, the fiscal year that ends June 30, was over $50 million operationally, and that's not counting additional investment losses in our working capital pool. We anticipate and project that there will be additional losses of $7 million over the course of the summer. With that kind of revenue loss, that kind of loss affecting all of higher education, we have to think about not just our ability to sustain that level of loss, but we have to think about the impact on our community and on jobs as we begin to make decisions for opening or reopening down the road. So, when could we reopen residentially? What are the factors that we consider in making a decision whether or not summer, or for that matter, whether or not fall, would be an appropriate time to begin bringing students back to campus?\nWell, here too, we're guided by advice from federal and state authorities, we're guided by advice from academic experts including our own, we're guided by advice of business groups that are providing recommendations to their communities as to when businesses can be reasonably reopened. And some of the best guidance we've seen actually, came over a month ago from the American Enterprise Institute, where they laid out pretty clear parameters that govern when an institution can begin to think about reopening for business or in our case, reopening for residential education. And those are, a steady reduction in the case load in the relevant geographic area. And they recommend a steady reduction in cases over a period of 14 days. The presence of adequate treatment capacity to treat those who are infected and affected in your community. The presence of adequate testing capacity and the presence of adequate monitoring, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation capabilities. And when you look at all of that together and you think about where we are today as we look forward to the start of summer term in a little less than two months' time, and ask, do we have these?\nThe answer for most of those is, no. We have been pleasantly surprised, perhaps due to the effectiveness of some of the social distancing measures in the Upper Valley, that our local medical system, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, has seen far fewer cases of COVID-19 than they had anticipated. So, we do at this moment in time, have adequate treatment capacity in the Upper Valley healthcare system. But on all of the other measures including effective testing capacity, availability of PPE, monitoring into contact tracing capacity, we are not where we need to be to consider a significant reopening residentially of our campus. So the decision we announced was to be remote only for the summer, with our coursework to be graded, as Dean Elizabeth Smith and I had announced, in mid-March when we indicated that the spring term would be a term with no credit grading only. We announced for our sophomores who will not be able to have a residential sophomore summer experience this year, that if they wish, they could choose instead to be in residence in the summer of 2021, to experience that summer in Hanover as part of their education.\nWe also announced the cancellation of on-campus Tuck Bridge program, the remote start of the Tuck and Geisel master in health care delivery science programs, and the cancellation of all on-campus athletic camps, performing arts events and the Hanover Country Club for the summer. Basically, physically, at this point in time, we have announced that the campus is remaining closed for educational activity and for residential activity over the course of the summer. So with those decisions, what comes next? The first thing that I know is on the minds of many of our undergraduate students, is the logistical question. Now that summer term is not happening as a residential term, how will we return your belongings to you that you had to leave behind when you went home for spring break? That's something that taskforce is working on and I'm going to turn to Josh Keniston and Lisa Adams in a few minutes, to provide some insight in the answers to that question.\nWhat about grading? What does a graded summer experience look like? Well, we will return to graded and evaluated coursework, but our faculty committees are working through questions around the specific parameters, whether or not we might, for example, expand the NRO option, and I anticipate having an announcement out to campus with the details on that within the next two weeks. And what about fall term itself? As we think about fall term, the immediate and obvious options that may come to mind for everyone are the two extremes. Either fall term is another term that is fully remote learning, continuing the practice of spring term and summer term, or fall term is a full residential term with everyone back on campus life as usual, business as usual.\nAs I sit here over these past few months and talk with epidemiologists, talk with physicians, talk with our scientists, talk with public health officials and talk with our colleagues on the task force, is becoming increasingly clear to me that the opportunity for a flip the lights switch, return to normal, business as usual operation, is, well I won't say impossible, highly unlikely, for us or any of our other peer or higher educational institutions. So, where does that leave us?\nIt leaves us considering and contemplating things that I would call, hybrid operation. Where some fraction of our students would come back to campus, some fraction of our students would continue in residential learning. But let me say clearly and unequivocally, that in all of these options, Dartmouth will be open as an educational institution this fall. We are not in any way contemplating cancellation of the fall academic quarter. We are working diligently right now with the task force to figure out how we can most effectively structure that fall term, and how we can bring safely and securely the maximum number of students back to campus for our residential experience this fall. How are we going to get there as we think about the summer and the months ahead? Well, first and slowly, as I said to a student reporter from The D who interviewed me the other day, we are going to begin focusing this summer and the very near term, on the slow reopening of our ... focusing this summer in the very near term on the slow reopening of our research facilities, bringing in graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and some faculty and staff back to campus in a very staged, managed and measured function.\nWe know that through that experience, over the course of the summer, we will learn some of the steps that will be essential to protect community health when we bring larger numbers of undergraduate students and graduate students back to campus in the fall.\nWe have just put in place this week, through collaboration with our partners at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a health working group that is going to help us think through exactly how we can manage the population health, manage student, faculty and staff, on-campus health through this fall by figuring out how to effectively test and frequently test the community for presence of the disease, how to procure adequate personal protective equipment, what social distancing guidelines we can put in place, how we can effectively manage contact tracing when someone is believed to or is expected to have developed symptoms of COVID-19, what kind of monitoring can we have in place to monitor and manage community health and what kind of quarantine and isolation facilities will we have?\nOur taskforce will focus on how we accomplish these things and an academic working group composed of deans and associate deans will be working with me to figure out how we structure the curriculum, recognizing that it's likely to be hybrid, with some students on-campus and some students learning remotely, to most effectively meet the educational needs of our students.\nThere's a lot of complexity embedded in all of this and so a question I'm sure that is on everyone's mind is when will we be able to make a decision of when we will announce? We anticipate announcing our plan for the fall term by the end of June. June 29th is the operational date we have given ourselves to announce that decision.\nOur fall course selection process, because we are not going to make an announcement on the structure of fall term until June 29, is therefore going to be postponed. Rather than having students register for courses in May, we are going to postpone the listing and timetables of courses to mid-July and registration for fall term classes will happen over the course of July.\nBut first week before we get to those points, we need to make and announce operational decisions around belongings, around grading, around June virtual commencement plans, which I anticipate are releasing in the next few weeks and around fall off-campus programs and travel.\nEmbedded in all of this, we also need to be thinking about steps that we will need to take in the coming months to address the extraordinary financial and budgetary challenge that COVID-19 has imposed upon this campus.\nBut let me simply say in closing that guiding us in all of these steps is going to be adherence to the first principles that I outlined at the very beginning. It is an absolute focus on the health and safety of our community, our students and our faculty and staff and the local members of the Upper Valley community.\nIt is on focusing on the educational continuity research and training of our students undergraduate and graduate alike. Let me say we are doing that with the community that continues to inspire me. It has been an extraordinarily resilient and supportive community.\nI had meetings with two faculty committees last week and the stories I was hearing from the faculty committees and from department chairs in a meeting with all of the arts and sciences and their department chairs, just two days ago this week, about how the faculty are engaging with students, how the students are engaging with the faculty and how everyone is embracing this shift to remote learning. It's been truly extraordinary.\nLet me finally say before I turn it to Justin to take your questions that some of you who know me know that I'm quietly competitive and not that I like to see us in a position that beats the rest of the Ivy League, but I will point out this. Dartmouth, because of the nature of our academic calendar, has somewhat of an advantage here. All of our peer institutions had to make decisions to go to remote learning in the middle of an academic semester. We made the decision to do so at the start of the spring term, the spring quarter. So, we will have by the end of this term, a full quarter in academic experience teaching and learning remotely under our belts.\nWe will get a second term of remote learning completely under our belts by the end of the summer. So, when September 1 arrives, the scorecard will say that Dartmouth has had two complete terms of learning how to effectively engage with students, challenge our students, provide assignments, grade assignments and work with our students, mentoring and advise our students by remote learning, where many of our peers across the country are just about to start their very first semester of full online learning.\nWe won't keep this to ourselves. The academic community, as I said, has been extraordinary and we will be sharing with them lessons that we have learned just as they have been sharing with us lessons that they've been learned along the way. Let me stop there. Thank you all for your engagement and for listening. We'll turn it to Justin Anderson who will moderate some of the questions that I can see that you've been sending in. Thank you. Justin.\nJustin Anderson:\nThanks a lot, Joe. It's nice to be with you, although it's only virtual. It's nice to see you. A lot of questions have come in over the course of the last 10 minutes. You just addressed what may happen in the fall. Fair number of questions about the summer, two questions in particular. I'm seeing a lot of questions about the return of staff to campus. One question, when will staff return to campus and then, how will you determine which departments or areas open first?\nHelble:\nA really good question and one could ask, in fact, the same questions about research laboratories and how we would determine which ones will open first and what the schedule will be. First and foremost, we need to be responsive to the guidance and, in fact, executive orders of the governors of New Hampshire and Vermont. We are waiting for their indication that restrictions can be relaxed and we can begin to contemplate a lessening of the work from home expectation or requirement.\nThe task force has working groups that are looking at which functions we can and should first bring back to campus. Initially, I anticipate those will be functions that are either struggling to get their work done effectively through remote learning or those that are supporting the on-campus research enterprise is the first place to start. That's something that is going to be a work-in-progress over the course of the summer and as I said, our guidance has to be driven by state guidelines and, in fact, executive order requirements in the near term.\nWhen will it happen? It's a question I'm asked often. This is a guess. I will say I am hopeful that by late June or the beginning of July we'll begin to be able to bring people back to campus. It might be sooner. It might be later. That's simply my best guess sitting where I am today.\nJustin Anderson:\nThanks, Joe. This next one, I'm assuming, is from, well it could be from a student or even a student considering coming to Dartmouth, when will a decision be made about first-year trips, FYSEP, orientation?\nHelble:\nAs you might imagine as we think about the academic programs for the fall, when we think about the schedule for the fall, there are groups who are looking very actively at the best ways to engage with incoming first-year students. What does that mean for FYSEP? What does that mean for first-year trips? I think we will be in a position where we can make decisions on first-year trips sooner than the June 29 deadline that we have announced for anticipating announcing the structure of the academic fall term. How much sooner? I don't know. I don't anticipate that we'll be in a position to give an answer to that over the next couple of weeks.\nOur first order of business is to look at international travel programs for the fall and I know that there is a working group in the task force that is committed to making recommendations around fall off-campus programs, language study and foreign study programs by mid to late May. I would imagine that we will be making decisions around FYSEP, other residential programs like FYSEP, first-year orientation, first-year trips in the same timeframe, so mid-May to late May, possibly early June.\nAnderson:\nThanks. This question just came in about the endowment. Is there a possibility that trustees could find a middle ground between the fear of depleting our endowments and using this amazing rainy day fund for this extraordinary rainy day?\nHelble:\nIn fairness, Justin, that's a good point because this is an extraordinarily rainy day. It's a rainy day in ways that no one ever anticipated. Higher ed has experienced economic crisis before, but it's the combination of the depth and the rapidity of the transition in operations and the transition financially that is something that we truly have not seen as a community of educators ever in our history.\nHow do we think about the endowment in this context? This is a question that friends and colleagues in town and on-campus have asked me by email frequently, because I'm not seeing too many people face-to-face, but frequently are asking me this question. The endowment, I think you used the term rainy day fund. You have to be very careful in acknowledging that the endowment, in fact, is not a rainy day fund. It is funding that was provided to the institution over generations with very specific purposes in mind.\nMost of the uses of the endowment are restricted, restricted by SOU, statement of understanding. They are, in fact, essentially legally restricted. Where a donor gives us money very generously to support a specific building, a specific program, a specific faculty member's faculty line.\nThe funds that come in through earnings on the endowment are used and can be used to support that activity only. They're not fungible and they can't be used to address institution-wide operational funding deficits. I think we need to remember in all of this is that we are, in fact, using the endowment to support the operations of the institution. Dartmouth's fiscal year 2020 budget is roughly a billion dollars in the endowment. Earnings on the endowment support over $250 million dollars of those operations.\nWhy not draw more? There's a fundamental principle that you'll hear the president, you'll hear me, you'll hear the sport, the board, you'll hear many of us speak about when we speak about the endowment and the use of the endowment, and that's one of intergenerational equity. Dartmouth is the institution that Dartmouth is today because of the generous philanthropy of alumni and friends of generations past. It was stewarded and protected and preserved that enabled us to draw operating funds that enable us to have faculty we have on-campus today, that enable us to have jobs that we have on-campus today, that enabled us to have financial aid for students that we have on-campus today.\nIf those decisions had not been made to preserve the endowment, even in past moments of financial crisis, we would have fewer students, we would have fewer jobs, we would have less financial aid available, we would have fewer faculty, and so this principle of intergenerational equity doesn't just apply in the past. We have to think about carrying it forward for generations to come to preserve the continuity of operations and to preserve the core of the Dartmouth academic and educational mission.\nLet me just add, this is something I think about a lot by, perhaps, not to put too fine of a point on it, but I'm an engineer and I like to think about the quantitative aspect. I think about the numbers. We're facing roughly a $100 million dollar combined operating loss if you include the working capital portion for spring term and summer term alone.\nWhy not take a $100 million dollars out of the endowment if you could and use this to fill that gap? That $100 million dollars once you draw upon it is gone forever. It's not earning interest, the principal isn't growing going forward. That a $100 million dollars would generate $5 million dollars in annual operating budget support that our budgets count upon.\nTake that away, $5 million dollars, that is a hundred full scholarships for students that we would no longer be able to fund. It is 140 staff and faculty positions. The implications are huge to doing something that may seem like a simple step drawing from the endowment now to address an immediate financial question, financial challenge. For that reason, through generations, the trustees and the administrative leadership have always used the endowment as a resource of last resort because of the tremendous and long-lasting impacts it has on the future operations of the institution.\nAnderson:\nThanks, Joe. I guess, let's just stay on the issue of how we can fund our operation. There's a question about the use of the federal stimulus money, part of the CARES Act. The CARES Act, as you know, is a $2.2 trillion dollar federal bill. Of that $14.5 billion, was set aside for allocation to institutions of higher education. As such, Dartmouth has been allocated a certain amount of that money. The question is, is Dartmouth going to take advantage of the CARES Act to use for funding for undergraduate grants?\nHelble:\nThe CARES Act, as you know Justin, and as the centers may know, sets aside funding for each institution of higher learning in this country through a formula that looks at student need. It is support that is designed to help address the economic hardship that it is designed to help address the economic hardship faced by institutions and by the most needy students on campus. Dartmouth's allocation through formula has been announced at $3.4 million of support. We have not yet applied to accept that funding, but if we do, we are committing to applying 100% of that funding to support students and student needs.\nNow, as you might know, those of you who have been paying attention to the press on this know that there has been some pressure applied on some institutions to consider turning down the funding because of the size of the endowment or because of the scope of the university. But if you look at those institutions, and particularly if you look at Dartmouth, there is no question that there are students in need, there is no question that there are students and families whose financial need will be increasing significantly because of this economic hardship.\nSo we are thinking very carefully about the value of accepting those funds to support our students at this particular moment in time. And as a matter of principle, I think one needs to keep in mind our students absolutely need this funding to help support what Dartmouth can provide. And we also have to recognize that in a moment where we're asking all of the Dartmouth campus community through our salary freeze for faculty and staff, through the hiring freeze, through the request that everyone reduce their fourth quarter non-compensation expenses, we're asking everyone to make financial sacrifice. I think it's incumbent upon us to look to every source of support for the Dartmouth community and for our students. And so we were thinking very carefully about proceeding with filing an application to seek this funding.\nAnderson:\nThanks Joe. So we've been receiving questions now for over a half an hour and I'll tell you that the two most popular questions are number one, when and how can I get my belongings, which I know you said that Josh would address, so we'll get to that. But the other most popular question is about layoffs and furloughs and when decisions may be made about that or announcements made about whether or not that's happening.\nHelble:\nThat's another really important question for so many members of the Dartmouth community, and there I can say we are committed to being as transparent as we can about any decision we need to make and to announce any decision as soon as we possibly can. I think you know that when Dartmouth made the decision to suspend residential operations for spring term in the middle of March, we made the commitment to continue to pay at full salary, all members of the staff for three and a half months through the end of June in the hopes that the economic hardship that we were facing in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year would lessen and in the hopes that we will be in a position to begin returning to residential operation over the course of the summer. That now is not happening and we are thinking very carefully about what a full term operation, a hybrid operation would look like.\nOur needs to support students on campus are going to be driven significantly by the protocols we put in place to help preserve and protect the health of the community, faculty, staff and students, are going to be driven substantially by the number of students who are on campus and how our residential buildings are being used. So we can't answer the question about any potential furloughs or layoffs until we have better insight into what the fall term is going to look like.\nI said earlier, we're not going to announce the fall term decision and academic decision until the end of June, but we will not wait that long to make any announcements about potential furloughs or layoffs that might begin as early as July 1. And so we are committed to making decisions on those to the extent that we can by the beginning of June. And we will be open and transparent with the community as we go through that process. And it's something that I'm happy to continue to comment on in these weekly forums because I know how important it is to so many members of our community.\nAnderson:\nThanks Joe. We have time for one more question before we get to Josh and Lisa. This is another one that has been popping up a number of times. Is the COVID-19 taskforce doing anything to consider student input and perspectives?\nHelble:\nThey are. Other than on one committee, there is a working group that has been working as part of the task force to help us develop a structure for a potential virtual celebration and commencement ceremony in June, not to replace the physical commencement but to give us a marker in time of this celebratory moment in the conferral of degrees as we anticipate then a full physical and normal commencement ceremony in 2021. There have been students contributing very directly to that committee.\nIn other parts of the working group, there were not and have not been students on the task force or on the working groups because the individuals on the working group were individuals who were charged with making major financial and operational decisions, controlling operational units, managing facilities, overseeing academic program, directing travel programs for the campus. We have however sought and received significant student input, significant student perspective that has helped inform some of the decisions that we made.\nThere was a tremendous amount of student input that was sought and considered as we made the decision to have spring term be a credit, no credit grading term. There is student input being provided in a very structured and helpful way through the student assembly along series of questions that they provided to us in leadership in late March and a second series of questions that I just received this morning that we will be responding to by early next week, that helped provide the student perspective and ask for student guidance.\nAnd finally, I know that Dean Catherine Lively, the dean of the college and her team and student affairs have been hearing from students regularly and have also been reaching out to students proactively to seek student input on things like processes for getting belongings back that have been an important consideration as we develop plans for those steps that are happening next.\nSo there is a very important student voice in all of the processes we're undertaking, even absent having students for the reasons I articulated, being explicitly appointed to this task force that's comprised of institutional divisional leaders.\nAnderson:\nGreat. Thanks Joe. And speaking of the task force, I think you're about to speak to the chairs of the task force.\nHelble:\nYes. So thank you Justin and thanks to everyone who sent those questions in and please keep them coming. We will be doing this again on a regular basis and I look forward to taking more of your questions next Wednesday at the same time.\nI'd like to turn now to Josh Keniston and Lisa Adams, the co-chairs of the COVID-19 taskforce whom I interviewed earlier when I introduced at the beginning. I'm going to ask each of them just a few questions to help give you a sense of the work that they're doing, and then we're going to turn it over to you with questions moderated by Justin again that you can put directly to the task force.\nSo first I'd like to ask Josh and then Lisa to very quickly and succinctly give us a high level structure of the task force from your perspective and talk about your specific role on the task force and your specific and current focus since one of you comes very much from the operational side of managing the campus, and the other one is an infectious disease specialist from the Gazal school of medicine. Josh, why don't we start with you.\nKeniston:\nSure. Thanks Joe. Good to see you and good to see you too, Lisa. So the task force is, Joe, we report directly to you, but really our job is to coordinate across the institution. I've been at Dartmouth just about three years and never have I had the chance in such a short period of time to get to meet so many individuals and that's really been kind of a hidden perk here. But we've 24 individuals from all of the professional schools, from some of the key divisions that are represented on the task force. And then about a dozen sub working groups like travel support, business continuity, research continuity, a variety of areas all working on how right now, how do we think about fall and how do we track towards that.\nSo my role is really as the interim VP of campus services, is to come at this from an operational perspective, how do we think about getting the campus ready and responding.\nHelble:\nThanks. And Lisa as a physician scientist, tell us about your role on the task force.\nAdams:\nSure. Thanks again for having us participate. My role on the task force has really been to focus on the medical and public health aspects and the epidemiological data. I and my health and epidemiology colleagues are the ones who are closely examining that COVID-19 data for New Hampshire, for Vermont, for the U.S. and really across the globe. We are closely following the trajectories and slopes of the disease curves and looking at the various models that are designed to help us project what we can expect to see in the near future and longterm future.\nWe're also of course dealing with the uncertainty in the data and the model projections and doing our best to examine all available resources and sources and to make the most sound interpretations of the data.\nYou also mentioned that we're working very closely with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center colleagues and partners at the New Hampshire State Health Department to align our guidance, recommendations and plans for things like testing, access and capability and care delivery for our community. And you also mentioned, and I think it's worth highlighting that our broader task force goal and what I take very personally and seriously is really to do our best to safeguard the health and wellbeing of those in our community. So I see my role as making sure that we have the best available data and information to make sure that all of our recommendations and the decisions by senior leadership are based on the best available scientific and public health evidence.\nHelble:\nThanks. And how often are you in touch with the state epidemiologist or your colleagues at DH? I remember certainly in the early days of this, it seemed as if you were on at least one call, if not more daily.\nAdams:\nIt certainly was quite frequent in the early days, especially as practices were getting implemented and changes were coming fast and furious at us and information, and we were having our first cases and figuring out how we were going to be dealing with those in the community. So now, it has sort of tapered off to a steady state of almost daily with Dartmouth Hitchcock colleagues and a little bit less frequently now with the health department. There are good colleagues of mine from the infectious disease section who were involved in both state and Dartmouth-Hitchcock leadership, so we're always only a phone call away.\nHelble:\nOkay, great. So it's pretty clear there's still very frequent collaboration and connection. So one of the questions I've been asked, less so now in the later stages of our managing the disease here in the upper Valley community, but certainly frequently in the beginning was, how are we fairing? How many cases are there? Where are they? And how are we accommodating them on campus? I know some of this is information that needs to be protected, but what can you tell us about the numbers and how we're managing it on campus?\nAdams:\nSo what I can share is that to date, we've had just under 10 students with confirmed COVID-19 in the upper Valley. We're also aware that there've been a few cases amongst our employees. We know that there's community transmission in both New Hampshire and Vermont, so this really does not come as a surprise.\nWe've also heard from students who have moved outside of the upper Valley that they or a family member had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and our college health services providers have offered telehealth support to those students and I think are available to all students who have questions and concerns about COVID-19.\nNow, regarding self quarantine and self isolation, we have identified spaces on campus that we have cleared and cleaned to allow us to isolate up to 35 students who are ill but not ill enough to require hospitalization. And we've also cleared and cleaned rooms for a similar number of students who have been identified as contacts to individuals with COVID-19 and need to a self quarantine for 14 days.\nSo these are spaces that meet our infection control criteria of having a single room, a private bathroom. And then of course we've arranged for meal delivery for students in those spaces.\nNow, fortunately we've never had more than a dozen students in either our isolation or quarantine spaces at any one time, but we really feel that this has served as a good practice for us to know what will be needed practically and logistically and how will we manage when we are able to welcome more students back to campus.\nHelble:\nThanks Lisa, and I have to say one of the things I got to see firsthand a few weeks ago was the great lengths that the dining services staff have gone to take care of the students who are in isolation and quarantine. It's really extraordinary to see the steps they've taken both to prepare meals for students who are still here on campus, but also deliver food to those who are in isolation and quarantine.\nSo Josh, let me turn to you now with a question, the question perhaps it's on everyone's minds, at least all of the undergraduate students, and that is the belongings that were left behind on campus. And so I know the task force is working on this. I know that you promised me I'll be seeing the final plan very soon. What can you tell us about where that stands and when we we'll be able to announce the campus the plan for returning student belongings?\nKeniston:\nThat's a good one, Joe, and I'm not going to have the complete plan today, but I'll update you on where we are. We're working hard and we're probably about two weeks, if not sooner away from being able to roll that out. Dean Lively will follow up with those details as soon as they're ready. We all hoped this was not going to go on as long as it has. We are digging in and looking at what the options are. It's complex. We have about 3200 students' belongings that we need to deal with and it's things like how do you get thousands of boxes to box things up that we're looking at. We're looking at options to ship some of the stuff that needs to get there in a quicker timeframe.\nWe're looking at all of that information right now and putting together a plan. We'll roll that out, as I said, within the next two weeks. It's going to take the course of the summer to fully implement it. But, by the end of the summer, we'll be able to have belongings back to most of the students.\nHelble:\nThanks. That's encouraging. I'm sure for many it's not as soon as they would like. We know everyone would have loved to have had their belongings back the first week after we needed to close in the spring. But I also have to say that I've been impressed and appreciative of how the vast majority of students and their families have recognized that this is a public health crisis like none we've ever seen and have given us, the campus community and leadership, the flexibility to work through the plans.\nI'm really pleased to see that we're close to being able to roll out the plan and letting people know when they'll get their belongings back. Last question I'd like to ask the two of you briefly before we open it up to the audience is around the question of return to research to campus over the course of the summer. I know the two of you, as taskforce co-chairs, have a working group that's focused very specifically on this. Maybe, if you don't mind, I can just ask each of you to provide a little bit more detail on what they're considering and how they anticipate rolling that out and moving that forward.\nAdams:\nWhy don't I get us started then? As you mentioned, we have a working group. Our research continuity working group, which is led by our vice provost for research, Dean Madden. This is one of our many working groups. That working group is actively exploring how to carefully and intentionally restore research activity on campus, including what practices need to be in place to protect the health and safety of our community.\nThis will be a careful and intentional process and is likely to occur in a staged or phased in fashion. Some of the things that we're doing, that sort of my team will be involved in, is looking at lab spaces and personnel, and devising a ramp up plan that will take into consideration spacing so that we could allow the six foot social distancing. Perhaps limiting the number of people that are in the space over a day or even a week. Then also having to consider what are the cleaning or disinfecting practices of high touch surfaces. Maybe with that I'll turn it over to Josh to comment on that piece.\nKeniston:\nYeah. I mean, the other key piece that you hit on Lisa is, even within the labs, there are then the common spaces in the buildings. Part of what we're looking at is what are the appropriate standards to put in place for shared spaces like bathrooms or common touch areas like the exterior doors to buildings? We're working with facilities teams to think about how do we create the right level of disinfecting, and regular cleaning, and make sure that we have the staff ready to go.\nIt's a lot of coordination. The other piece we're watching closely is to make sure that the appropriate personal protective equipment is available. It's been an issue across the board. It's one that we watch very closely and want to make sure that the levels more broadly are available so that when our researchers are back that they have available what they need and that we are kind of doing it being aware of what the needs are for the medical community as well. A lot of balancing acts that have to be happening there to do that well.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thanks Josh. I'm pleased that you mentioned restrooms. There is a paper actually that I just saw in draft form this morning in nature science. It was a study done in some of the hospitals in Wuhan, China. They found that one of the areas they need to be most attentive to, where there was the highest aerosolized viral particle voting was, not surprisingly, in the restrooms. Let me ask Justin to turn to our audience and see if there are any questions coming in from outside that we can direct to the two of you.\nAnderson:\nIn fact, there are Joe. Thank you very much. I think this first question probably should go to Josh. It's an interesting one. Has the committee, or has the taskforce at all discussed the possibility of shortening the six week winter break in order to delay fall term and allow it to be conducted on campus? It appears as though a modification of the calendar would allow for more time to prepare for fall term. Is the six week break really necessary?\nKeniston:\nI would say the taskforce has examined lots of different permutations as we talk about fall. We've spent long hours thinking about the various ways to tackle this. At this point, I think our priority is to figure out what option allows us to get closest to what we would have called a normal type of operation. We'll be watching all of that closely.\nLisa, maybe you can comment a little bit more on the timing piece and how we're thinking about how that all impacts our decision making.\nAdams:\nNo. It's a good question. Certainly a scenario, as just Josh mentions, that we have considered. There are pros and cons to almost every permutation that we look at. The delayed start maybe gives us a little bit more planning time upfront, but we really have to think about what we gain in those extra weeks versus having a Thanksgiving break towards the end of the term. For which we know people may very much want to travel during.\nThat seems like the cost benefit there of having people, again, leave campus, return to campus. Would there be a 14 day self quarantine period as there is now for people entering the state from elsewhere? It gets very complicated. We are looking at what we can do to provide and really preserve and provide the best educational experience in the the timeframe that we have.\nAgain, everything's on the table right now as we're trying to keep an open mind about all this. But I do think we are weighing sort of pros and cons to scenarios such as that one.\nAnderson:\nThanks Lisa. I'm going to stay with you for this next question. It seems to be an area of expertise. If people who are sick are told to just stay home and isolate, rather than going to DH to be tested, how accurate do you feel the number of cases is for the Upper Valley?\nAdams:\nWe do know that our testing is not as complete as we would like it to be. The populations that we've been able to test are, it's a small, much smaller cohort than we would like to be able to test. That testing has been available in other countries.\nWe know that our results of individuals who have tested positive is a great underestimation of probably the true number of infections that are out there. By what factor? What is that ratio? We don't know exactly. There are some estimates out there. But I think, as we have more access to testing for both disease and to indicate past infection, we will be getting more information about what is the true extent of COVID 19 in our US population.\nAnderson:\nThank you for that Lisa. Josh, I'm going to go back to you. A number of questions have come in about the Hanover Country Club and its status given the recent announcements that it will be closed for the season. Can you speak a little bit about that decision?\nKeniston:\nYeah, I know that that's one that there is a lot of disappointment for individuals as many of the decisions that we've made have. The decision is just about this season at this point and was part of a larger decision about our summer activities on campus, and wanting to reduce the number of people on campus and really limit the operations of what we have this summer.\nThe decision is about this summer. We're in the process of issuing refunds for those who had membership fees. Then, as we look at the broader picture, as we get to the other side of the COVID crisis, we'll take a look at how we move forward with the golf course.\nAnderson:\nThanks Josh. We have time for one more question for you guys. I'll go back to Lisa for this one. It's an interesting question. Will incoming international students be prioritized for starting on campus in the fall? If some groups are allowed to attend, Will this include new international students? This question is about international students specifically. But the issue really is much bigger about, if we go to a hybrid model, how is the campus populated? I'll go to you for that one.\nAdams:\nYeah. Let me make a couple of points there. I think everyone knows that we already are housing some students on campus. A small number. Less than 200 students. Some of whom are international students who were not able to return home. We will certainly expect to continue to be doing that.\nIn terms of who would be returning to campus, if we are able to do that partially residential term for undergraduates starting in the fall, that is very much still under discussion and will certainly be a senior leadership decision. I will say too, just to keep in mind about what fall term might look like for every students that are returning, that we are still expecting that there will be a requirement around some of the public health measures that are in place now.\nSocial distancing, the frequent hand washing, the use of face coverings, the probably statewide ban on large mass gatherings. We expect those are still going to be in place. We will be working to allow the largest number of students that we feel like we can safely welcome back to the campus. But recognize that some of these public health measures, many of them are still likely to be in place. However students are welcomed back, there will be guidance and some of these measures that we will absolutely expect our students to adhere to.\nAnderson:\nThank you very much Lisa. Thank you also Josh. I appreciate your time and your willingness to engage with Joe and take some of these questions. There are a lot of questions that came in that we couldn't get to. I do encourage folks to check out Dartmouth's COVID 19 website, which you can get to through the home page.\nThere is a feature there, an email address that you can use to ask questions. We will try to respond to every question that comes in. If you didn't get your question answered today, please think about taking advantage of that opportunity. Of course, we'll be back next week and you'll have the ability to ask more questions. With that I'm going to go back to Joe.\nHelble:\nThanks Justin. Josh, Lisa, let me echo my thanks for all of your great work leading the task force these past two months. But also for being part of our conversation today. To everyone who's watching, I think you get a sense of the key, interrelated, challenging questions we need to address as we think about fall term.\nHow many students can we bring back? We're committed to bringing the maximum number possible back to campus safely and with health and safety first and foremost in our minds. Who are those students who get to come back if not everyone is able to return? What curriculum can we put in front of them and how will that differ for residential students versus those engaging in remote learning? Then, as Dr. Lisa Adams just said, what will campus life look like? What kind of restrictions, social distancing, PPE, contact tracing do we need to think about as we anticipate fall term operations?\nBut with all of that, I will say again what I said partway through my remarks this afternoon, Dartmouth will be open this fall. We are not contemplating cancellation of fall term. Fall term will take place. The challenge for us is to figure out in the next two months the appropriate operating model that enables us to bring the maximum number of students safely back to campus.\nLet me end there. Thank you all again for your interest and attention. We will be back at this time, 3:30, next Wednesday. I anticipate having as guests two members of the Dartmouth College faculty who will speak a bit about their engagement with students, and their experience, and what they are learning going through, for the first time, this tremendous remote learning experience at Dartmouth. Thank you everyone. Look forward to seeing you next Wednesday.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/community-conversations-april-29-2020-transcript"},
{"title": "Provost Helble Hosts First of Community Conversations", "text": "Watch the April 29, 2020, Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and guests Lisa Adams and Josh Keniston, co-chairs of the COVID-19 task force.\nDartmouth will announce by June 29 whether students will be able to return to campus for the fall term, Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday afternoon during the first of a series of Community Conversations broadcast live from Dartmouth Library's Starr Studio.\n\"Dartmouth will be open this fall,\" Helble said, describing the three scenarios campus leaders are considering for the term that begins in September: a fully remote term, a fully residential term, or\u2014most likely, he said\u2014a hybrid of the two.\n\"The challenge for us to figure out in the next two months is the appropriate model that allows us to bring the maximum number of students safely back to campus,\" Helble said, stressing that the priorities driving any decision include both protecting the \"health, safety, and well-being of the community\" and \"ensuring the educational continuity for our students.\"\nHelble was joined on the webcast by COVID-19 task force co-chairs Lisa Adams, associate dean for global health and an associate professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine, and Josh Keniston, interim vice president of campus services and vice president for institutional projects, who spoke from their respective homes.\nDuring a live question-and-answer session moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to the studio, Helble addressed Dartmouth's financial predicament in the face of a pandemic-driven global economic downturn.\nBy the end of June, he said, Dartmouth expects to be facing a \"roughly $100 million-dollar combined operating loss if you include the working capital portion for spring term and summer term alone.\"\nHe stressed that making up the shortfall is not as simple as taking the funds from the endowment, which mostly consists of funds legally restricted to predetermined uses. The endowment currently contributes around $250 million to Dartmouth's annual operating budget of more than $1 billion.\n\"The endowment is, in fact, not a rainy-day fund. It is funding that was provided to the institution over generations, with very specific purposes in mind,\" he said. These funds \"can't be used to address institution-wide operational funding deficits.\"\nThe issue is one of \"intergenerational equity,\" he said. \"Dartmouth is the institution that Dartmouth is today because of the generous philanthropy of alumni and friends of generations past that was stewarded and protected and preserved.\"\nAsked about the possibility of job cuts, Helble reiterated that Dartmouth is committed to pay all salaries through June 30, and promised an announcement by early June on whether there will need to be furloughs or layoffs.\nHe said that Dartmouth's leadership has not decided yet if it will apply for federal funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Dartmouth is eligible for approximately $3.4 million in funding. If Dartmouth were to accept the federal funds, he said, \"we commit today to applying 100 percent of that to support students and student needs.\"\nAsked about programming for incoming students, such as first-year trips, orientation, and the First Year Student Enrichment Program, Helble said he expects to be able to announce a decision by early June, and hopes to announce recommendations for fall off-campus programs by mid to late May.\nKeniston addressed what Dartmouth is doing to reunite students with possessions they left on campus at the end of winter term, saying that it would likely take through the summer to return most of the belongings to the approximately 3,200 students.\nA plan for doing so is expected to be in place two weeks from now, he said, acknowledging that the logistical complexities of the issue were greater than initially anticipated. \"We hoped this was not going to go on as long as it has.\"\nAdams described plans for Dartmouth to allow research activity to resume on campus beginning this summer.\n\"We have a research continuity working group that is actively exploring how to carefully and intentionally restore research activity on campus, including what practices need to be in place to preserve the health and safety of the community,\" she said. \"This is likely to occur in a staged or phased-in fashion.\"\nThe weekly series will air Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. for the remainder of the spring term as a forum for members of the Dartmouth community to ask questions and get updates from Helble and other campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next week's broadcast will feature two faculty members as guests.\nWednesday's live broadcast is available for viewing. Call-in numbers are available for community members who want to listen to the show without video. A link to the next broadcast, which includes the option to send in questions during the show, will be posted as soon as it is available.\nCommunity Conversations is produced by Dartmouth's Media Production Group and the Office of Communications.

{"title": "Dartmouth Issues New Face-Covering Policy for Employees", "text": "Dartmouth employees working on campus and at other Dartmouth work sites are now required to wear cloth face coverings. In addition, all students approved to be on campus or at other Dartmouth sites must follow the new face-covering policy, emailed to community members today by Dartmouth COVID-19 Task Force co-chairs physician Lisa Adams, an associate professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine, and Josh Keniston, vice president for institutional projects.\nIn addition to the face-covering policy, the pair provided updated travel guidance and shared guidelines explaining the phased approached that will be used to bring community members back to campus. The new face-covering policy, travel information, and the reopening levels that will determine when people can return to campus are available on the COVID-19 website.\n\"To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, Dartmouth now requires all persons to wear cloth face coverings at all times when using or accessing shared or communal spaces at any Dartmouth worksite and also when a minimum of 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to maintain. Six feet of physical distancing, often referred to as social distancing, remains important in slowing the spread of the virus,\" wrote Adams and Keniston.\nThe guidelines that are being used to decide when community members can return to campus are made up of five levels, ranging from \"essential access only\" to \"full access.\" Dartmouth is currently at the second-most- restrictive access level\u2014highly limited access\u2014under which essential operations can continue on-site, limited activities that cannot be performed remotely are taking place on site with approval, and all classes are delivered remotely.\nThe travel guidance continues to be updated to reflect new information from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. Keniston and Adams stressed that, given the risk of virus transmission and restrictions on travel, those who have not received specific authorization to be at Dartmouth should not come to campus.\n\"As our Dartmouth COVID-19 Task Force continues to address pandemic-related issues in preparation for the new academic year, the ongoing protests against systemic and systematic racism remind us how this pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities in myriad ways,\" wrote Adams and Keniston. \"At a time when there is so much need for dialogue and community across our country, it is especially frustrating to be unable to be together in the same physical space. We understand how disheartening that can be.\"\nFor the latest information on Dartmouth's response to the pandemic visit the COVID-19 website.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/06/dartmouth-issues-new-face-covering-policy-employees"},
{"title": "Hanlon and Richie Join This Week's Community Conversation", "text": "Dartmouth will soon be applying for the first portion of the approximately $3.4 million in federal funds it is eligible for through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, President Philip J. Hanlon '77 said during this week's Community Conversations broadcast, a weekly online forum hosted by Provost Joseph Helble.\n\"The first tranche of CARES Act money\"\u2014approximately $1.7 million\u2014\"by law goes right to students, and we certainly have students who have these needs,\" President Hanlon said in response to a viewer's question. \"Yes, I'm certain we will apply for the first tranche of CARES Act money.\"\nHanlon and Laurel Richie '81, chair of the Dartmouth Board of Trustees, joined Helble (speaking, as usual, from the Starr Studio in Dartmouth Library's Baker-Berry Library) via Zoom\u2014Hanlon from his office in Parkhurst, and Richie from her home in New York City. The three answered viewer questions in a conversation moderated by Justin Anderson, vice president for communications, who spoke from a room adjacent to the Starr Studio.\nAnderson said he was hearing \"a ton of interest\" about when a decision would be made regarding this year's first-year trips.\n\"We will have that decision announced by the end of this week,\" Helble said, noting that the COVID-19 task force is currently putting the final touches on its recommendation.\nSpeaking about the June 14 virtual ceremony to confer degrees on graduating students\u2014a celebration that will not replace an in-person commencement for the Class of 2020, to be held in June 2021\u2014Richie said that all the trustees would be tuned in to the celebrations from wherever they are.\n\"I don't know that we'll all be in caps and gowns, but we'll be there, and we'll be participating, cheering the class on.\"\nHanlon noted that the choice of speaker for the celebration\u2014Khan Academy founder Salman Khan\u2014accepted his invitation to speak back in November, well before the pandemic forced large public gatherings online. \"It turned out to be a very timely choice, for sure,\" Hanlon said. Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing free online classes to people worldwide.\nBoth Hanlon and Richie spoke about their efforts to stay engaged with the Dartmouth community during the pandemic, as well as their communication with leaders in higher education, business, and media as they consider Dartmouth's future not only during this crisis but in the long term.\n\"It's urgent that we take on not just how are we going to get through the next academic year, but what do we want Dartmouth to be in five to 10 years?\" Hanlon said. \"This is a moment when we're doing a lot of thinking.\"\nRichie said she and other trustees have met via Zoom with the alumni council, the newly elected president and vice president of the student assembly, and other constituent groups.\n\"I know I speak for the board when I say that we have great passion for Dartmouth,\" Richie said. \"We are working hard to stay connected with all facets of the Dartmouth community.\"\nHanlon has been holding virtual office hours on Zoom, sessions that are \"jammed,\" he said. \"These calls are a great opportunity to let students know that I feel for them, and to give them an honest appraisal of the complex and uncertain situation that we find ourselves in. But also to express my confidence that our Dartmouth community, with all its creativity and resolve, will help us come through these turbulent times in a stronger place.\"\nAnd, he said, \"I take great pride in Dartmouth being a place where the campus leadership has an open door to every member of the community. It's a place where students can reach out and schedule a Zoom call with the president, and that doesn't happen on very many campuses.\"\nAsked if Hanlon and others on the senior leadership team would be taking a pay cut as Dartmouth considers the budgetary challenges ahead in fiscal year 2021, the president said that \"different members of the senior leadership team have voluntarily given back between 5 and 20% of their salary,\" with Helble and Executive Vice President Rick Mills each giving back 20%. Hanlon himself has dedicated 20% of his salary to financial aid through his gift to the Dartmouth College Fund.\nThat gift supports Dartmouth's urgent, renewed focus on financial aid through the Call to Lead campaign, a focus Hanlon announced last week, along with plans to expand the family-income threshold for a full-tuition undergraduate scholarship to $125,000, a renewed emphasis on annual giving, creation of a special scholarship bridge fund, an increase in Dartmouth's endowed scholarships.\n\"We all know that financial aid is a timeless priority for the college,\" Hanlon said. \"But as timeless as it is, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it's taken on even greater urgency as we've seen an enormous spike in students' financial needs.\"\nHanlon says he expects at least an $8 million deficit in the financial aid budget for the coming fiscal year. \"Dartmouth will and must step up to meet the additional financial needs of our students,\" he said. \"The Call to Lead is one mechanism that can galvanize alumni and parent support and help us meet that end.\"\nRichie said that during her travels on behalf of Dartmouth last year, \"One of the refrains in all of our conversations was that a family's ability to pay should never ever get in the way of a student's ability to enjoy the full Dartmouth experience. And that is true to our core.\"\nSeveral viewers asked whether students would be in residence during the fall term, a decision Helble said would be announced June 29. Hanlon offered some insight into the principles behind the fall term decision-making process. \"To me, the three words I think about to guide my thinking are courage, caution, and caring,\" he said.\nCourage is necessary \"to carry on the important work of Dartmouth College\u2014preparing our students to lead lives of leadership and impact, and advancing the frontiers of knowledge,\" he said.\nCaution, because much about COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and uncertain, from the disease's trajectory to when there might be an effective vaccine or treatment.\n\"Given all of this uncertainty, we must plan cautiously to put in place testing, physical distancing, and isolation protocols for the coming terms\u2014as well as the ability to nimbly embrace alternative directions should the situation require,\" he said.\nFinally, he said, \"One of the very distinctive features of the Dartmouth community is how much we care for each other and look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable.\"\nCommunity Conversations is a weekly online forum for members of the Dartmouth community to ask questions and learn from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next week, on June 3, the discussion will focus on Dartmouth's operations as the institution begins to make decisions about its budget and about fall term, Helble said.\nThe broadcast will take June 10 off and return on June 17.

{"title": "'Sparking' Research About Life During the Pandemic", "text": "Only a few weeks after the novel coronavirus began taking its grim toll, Dartmouth scholars from a range of disciplines got to work, in direct response to the health crisis, on innovative projects. The funding came through the Office of the Provost, thanks to an anonymous donation supporting \"Spark\" grants, averaging about $7,000 per initiative.\n\"So far we have supported nine projects, totaling nearly $63,000, with an additional $13,400 from other sponsors, including The Dartmouth Institute, the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute for Public Policy, the Tuck School of Business, and the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning,\" says Dean Madden, vice provost for research. \"This is truly a campus-wide effort, and the topics are fascinating, creative, and timely.\"\nAssessing Access to Medical Care\nSome of the research addresses issues of medical access during this critical time. For example, Judy Rees, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Geisel School of Medicine, is studying \"COVID-19 in New Hampshire,\" providing essential longitudinal data to guide public policy decisions in the state.\nElizabeth Carpenter-Song, a research associate professor of anthropology; Anne Sosin, program director for the Global Health Initiative at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding; and Lisa Adams, associate dean for global health and an associate professor of medicine in the Section of Infectious Disease and International Health at Geisel, are investigating \"The Need for Rapid Research to Assess Impact of COVID-19 in the U.S.,\" with a particular focus on the impact of the disease in rural environments.\nDaisy Goodman, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology, and of community and family medicine at Geisel and assistant professor at The Dartmouth Institute, and Ilana Cass, chair and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Geisel, are evaluating cell phone deployment \"to reduce disparities in access to telemedicine for rural, low-resource pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\"This program is critically important now because pregnant people and families are experiencing high levels of anxiety and isolation,\" says Goodman. \"Lack of access to technology has widened disparities in care and threatens to widen disparities in outcomes.\"\nLearning About Response to Disease\nTwo projects address the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations. Sienna Craig, associate professor of anthropology, is looking at \"Structural Inequality and Epidemiological Invisibility: Himalayan New Yorkers Respond to COVID-19,\" investigating the need for culturally aware communications with diverse communities.\nAbigail Neely and Patricia Lopez, both assistant professors of geography, are tracking \"The Social and Political Implications of COVID-19 for Care Labor in the U.S.,\" evaluating differences in the experiences among caregivers in rural and urban communities.\nEllie Kyung, an associate professor of business administration at the Tuck School of Business, is looking into the way people are responding to the unprecedented health threat, with \"COVID-19 Risk Perceptions and Behavioral Compliance.\"\nMathematics and computer science are also represented in the Spark cohort.

{"title": "Community Conversations, May 13, 2020 Transcript", "text": "May 13, 2020 TRANSCRIPT\nJoseph Helble:\nWelcome everyone to our third community conversation, addressing planning, response, and operations at Dartmouth College in the time of COVID-19. I'm Joe Helble, provost at Dartmouth College, and I'm joining you this afternoon from the Star Instructional studio in Berry Library on a beautiful, but very quiet spring day on the Dartmouth College campus.\nI'm joined this afternoon by Justin Anderson, our VP for communications from another studio here on campus, by our dean of the College and professor of sociology, Katherine Lively joining us from her home, and by our VP for campus services, Josh Keniston, who is also the co-chair of our COVID-19 taskforce, also joining us from his home in the Upper Valley.\nThis afternoon, I'll provide a brief update on some of our planning and decision making related to COVID-19, talk about developments since our conversation last week, take some live Q&A from you our viewers, and then turn to Katherine and Josh will speak about some of their work and specifically Dean Lively's announcement this morning detailing some of the work that the task force has been conducting around the returning of student possessions that have been here on campus since we made the decision to go to a term of remote learning in early March.\nOur goal through these community conversations is to expand on our written communications, provide a weekly update on what we're working on, and as always, answer your questions as best and as openly as we can.\nNow, over the past two weeks, the task force has been focused on developing the logistics around several plans through its different working groups. One working group has been focusing on the details of a virtual ceremony to confer degrees to graduating students this June and also planning for the June, 2021 commencement ceremony for the graduates of the class of 2020. They've also been working through a different working group on plans associated with the gradual reopening of research facilities on campus, and also, as I mentioned at the outset, the plan to return your belongings.\nNow, the ladder has been on the questions of many, Dean Lively, VP Keniston, co-chair Dr. Lisa Adams and I have been hearing about it as have others on campus, almost from the moment that students left campus in mid-March. We understand its importance to our community, and even though it was a relatively simple question, how will belongings be returned? As I'm sure many can imagine the details and logistics were extraordinarily complex. In this morning's message Dean Lively provided some of those details. I'll just provide you now with a very quick high level summary.\nOur goal in developing this plan, a plan that the task force developed in consultation with our student affairs community and staff, was to give our students a choice to store, ship, or allow pickup of their belongings over the course of the summer, following public health guidance and the guidance and assessment of the task force. We're going to start that process by collecting information on student preferences and as Dean Lively's message this morning to the student community indicated, you will be hearing from the student affairs office and the student affairs team over the next two days by email. And so students who left belongings on campus, we ask you to please be attentive to and responsive to that email. The sooner we have your preferences, the sooner the campus team can begin to act on those and put in place plans to return belongings.\nOur intention is to start with seniors first and then move to the remainder of our residential undergraduates. And again, details were in the note and Dean Lively and VP Keniston will be with us shortly to address any questions that may be on your mind.\nOur intention is to complete the process by late summer in time to prepare and transition our undergraduate residential facilities for use by residential undergraduates at the start of fall term.\nNow, with the belongings plan now developed and shared with the community, let me turn briefly to the question of research. As I mentioned last week, research has in fact continued throughout this period of remote operations at Dartmouth, but there is a need on the part of some investigators in some research projects to return to the laboratory, to return to the bench, to be able to collect data, to make progress against a defined research agenda. The research continuity working group has been making great progress and while it may take a few days longer than the end of this week to finalize plans, we anticipate that by the latest, by the middle of next week, we will be able to announce to the community, our initial plan for beginning to bring some gradual research activity back to campus over the course of the summer. We anticipate being able to bring some activity back to campus as early as June 1 or perhaps earlier, and again, details will be announced by the middle of next week. And in next week's community conversation, Vice Provost for Research Dean Madden will join me to speak about the details of the plan and answer questions about the slow ramp up of research activity on campus over the course of the summer.\nAs I said last week, as we ease restrictions incrementally, I need to stress that it will not be business as usual in all research laboratories immediately at the beginning of June. It will be a slow and gradual ramp up, and I understand and have heard from many the desire to move as quickly as we can, but we are very intentionally taking a deliberate and deliberative approach to this so that we can move slowly, but with confidence and also the capacity to identify, isolate and address any unanticipated problems that may arise to learn safely as we go along.\nTo any of the scientists in our community, I would say it will not be a linear process and it is intentionally going to start slowly, but as we move along, as we learn, and as restrictions are lifted, we will begin to bring more of our research activity to campus at an accelerating rate as we can over the course of the summer.\nAs with everything, our goal is to ensure the health and safety of our community, faculty, staff, students, and the broader Upper Valley community in every action that we take, in every decision that we put in place.\nNext, let me turn briefly to the question of grading and specifically grading of summer courses during summer term. Dean Elizabeth Smith and I announced in early March when the transition to remote learning for spring term was made, that while spring term would be graded on a credit/no-credit basis, our anticipation was that summer term would be a return to graded courses across the curriculum. That remains the case, and the question that has been discussed by faculty and by faculty committees over the past few weeks is whether there would be any adjustments to the grading policy, whether an expanded NRO option would be considered, or whether it would be a typical term of grading such as you would have in a residentially operated term.\nOver the course of the past week and a half the committee on instruction, the committee on organization and policy and other faculty groups have met to discuss the proposals and the options, and next the opportunities and different ways of considering grading will move to the department and program chairs within arts and sciences, that will happen over the course of the next week. So I therefore anticipate that we will be able to put out an announcement describing the details of summer term grading around Memorial day, either late next week or very early the following week shortly after. Now, let me comment briefly on the status of our planning for fall term. President Hanlon and I have made a commitment to announce our decision, the decision of the campus regarding full term operation by June 29, and that commitment remains intact.\nOver the course of the past week, the joint Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth Working Group has begun to meet and address questions related to healthcare considerations. They are a health management working group that is helping us think through how best to protect campus and community health as we return larger number of students to residential learning and residential operations over the course of the fall term. There are two high level questions that they are helping us work through. One is first, what is the maximum number of students that we can bring back and host in a residential learning environment beginning in fall term. And then second, a higher level question, whether we should focus on fall term alone in our planning, or we should step back and think of the entire academic year as our planning horizon in an integrated fashion. And should we even think about summer as part of that?\nSo these are the options that are being thought through. These are the options that we are going to be considering. And in both of those, I cannot say often enough, it is the health and safety of the community that is going to guide and drive our decision making.\nNow, I know on the minds of many, as soon as we speak about potentially operating in an environment that is not a full residential environment with every student on campus, is the question of who will be on campus. If it's not everyone who will those students be? And here I have to ask for your patience and say again, it's premature for us to discuss who until we decide how many, and whether we address this as a fall term question or a question covering the full academic year.\nWhat are the factors that guide that decision? Again, first and foremost, they are health-related questions, things, as you might imagine, how often do we test members of the community? Who do we test? Do we test only individuals who are symptomatic or do we test everyone according to some frequency? How do we test? Viral test or antibody test? How do we sample? How feasible is it to do that on a frequent schedule? How do we treat a positive test? Managing quarantine capacity is a very different consideration with a heavily occupied campus as compared to our situation during spring term, with only approximately 180 students resident on campus. How do we monitor? Is self-reporting sufficient? How do we contact trace? So on and so forth?\nSo as the working group helps us work through these questions, we will get closer to a determination of the maximum number of students we feel that we can safely and comfortably support, and that in turn will drive other decisions and we will announce these as we work up to a final decision associated with fall term.\nIn all of these, let me say that I appreciate the interest in the community and are making this decision as quickly as possible, but we will adhere with other decisions, be methodical, be thorough, be thoughtful and be data-driven. There are no shortcuts to getting to a thoughtful decision, and there is a lot of uncertainty associated with the development of this disease, it's infectious pathway and what the summer and fall term are projected to look like. So please bear with us. We will be as open and honest as we can about our conversations and deliberations, and again, remain committed to providing a decision by June 29.\nFinally, I know many of you have questions on budget. I've described in the past steps we've taken as a community to address the immediate budgetary challenge associated with the change in operations in spring term of 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-compensation spending has been significantly reduced in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, a hiring freeze has been put in place for the first half of fiscal year, 2021, through the end of the calendar year, a wage freeze has been put in place for all faculty and staff, and we are using the revenue stabilization reserve that president Hanlon helped create when he arrived as president in 2013, specifically to address moments like this, where revenue falls significantly before low projections.\nMuch remains uncertain regarding fiscal year 21, the fiscal year starting July 1 and beyond. Last week, I announced the process that would involve various committees, helping us work through some of the budgetary questions and decisions that need to be made around operations for FY 21 and beyond. Those committees have been meeting over the course of the past week and this week, and we have indicated that we intend to move forward with letting divisional leaders know FY 21 budget targets within the next several weeks, certainly by the end of May. That remains our goal.\nSo let me end simply on a positive note and with a thank you, a thank you to the generous members, those alumni and other members of the Dartmouth community who contributed to the development of an emergency student relief fund to help many of our students in challenging financial situations with the transition from winter to spring term and the abrupt cancellation of on campus classes. Through your generosity, we've received more than $185,000 and used that funding to support student travel home, supplemental employment awards in COVID related educational expenses for our students. Though we have received many questions on this funding, the funding has been fully allocated and was allocated by the financial aid office, according to their normal process for determining student financial need.\nWith the transition from winter to spring, and now approaching spring to summer complete or underway, we're turning our attention in our planning to the fall, knowing that the economic circumstances of many students, many families, and many members of the Dartmouth community have changed dramatically. We are fully expecting that there will be a need for increased financial aid over the course of the upcoming academic year, and we remain committed to our fundamental principles of being a need blind institution and meeting the full demonstrated financial need for our students.\nSo let me end by simply saying, I appreciate the engagement of the Dartmouth community, your questions, and your patience and understanding. With those of us who are seeking your input and working to make decisions to help this campus navigate its way through the COVID-19 pandemic and also your patients with one another in the global Dartmouth community. These are extraordinarily challenging and unprecedented times for all of us. And I asked for, and thank you for your support of one another as members of the Dartmouth community as we find our way forward. So thank you, and Justin, I'll turn to you now for some questions before we bring Dean Lively, and VP Keniston on to discuss some of the work of the task force, and the dean of the College area.\nJustin Anderson:\nThanks so much, Joe, and nice to see you today.\nHelble:\nGreat to see you, Justin.\nAnderson:\nAs you might imagine, a vast majority of the questions that have come in so far pertain to the announcement earlier today about the return of the belongings, and I promise we will get to those questions, but we'll start, Joe, with some questions for you that are not related to that, and there are some, not many, but there are some. The first question, \"Will the task force be issuing guidelines for return to work, where faculty, staff, students, union members, have typically worked at shared equipment? Will environmental safety and health be involved? Will cleaning supplies be provided, or will labs, studios, shops, et cetera, have to use their own funding to restock?\"\nHelble:\nSo Justin, that's a great set of comprehensive questions. Let me answer at a high level, and then perhaps, we can bring the question back when Josh and Kathryn are with us, because Josh, since he's VP of campus services, in addition to being co-chair of the task force, may have more information to provide. So at a high level, the answer is yes, environmental health and safety has been involved, and the task force is very attentive, through several working groups, to the need, to be careful and thoughtful about workplace regulations and rules, when we are bringing students, faculty, and staff back to campus, the need to be protective of the health of every member of the community, and the need to think about things like disinfection of shared spaces and shared equipment. And so, the questioner asked a great question. Yes, the task force is attentive to it, yes, EH&S is deeply involved, and in terms of the specifics, I'm going to defer to Josh.\nAnderson:\nThe next question I have, Joe, is about the Dartmouth College Childcare Center.\nHelble:\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\nAnderson:\n\"Are there considerations for opening the Dartmouth College Childcare Center? Who is making this decision, and what is the timeline for sharing information with the community? Can any accommodations be made for faculty and employees, who are being expected to teach and work from home with small kids?\"\nHelble:\nYeah. Thank you, Justin. And so, this is one of the things we recognize as an extraordinary challenge for members of our community, and in some ways, particularly for faculty or for staff who will be involved in teaching over the course of the summer, without the availability of readily and reliably provided childcare. So we need to take our guidance from the state around the reopening of childcare facilities. This is something that EVP Rick Mills and I have discussed with the task force, and again, this is something that Rick and the task force are thinking about.\nWe do hope to be able to reopen the childcare center at some point, I can't promise a specific date. Again, it's going to be driven by guidance from the state and our determination as to when it is safe to do so. If, and when we do reopen, it will likely not be at full capacity. But having said that, we recognize the importance of this as an important asset to the community, and the need for the faculty and the staff working with them, who will be delivering course content over the course of the summer. So I can't offer a date today, but I can tell you that it is something that Rick and the task force are keenly attentive to, and are working on right now.\nAnderson:\nJoe, in your opening remarks, you mentioned financial aid and the anticipation that the need will go up, and this is an issue that's on a lot of people's minds. A question that came in is about the decision making, \"Will financial aid decisions for summer and fall 2020 tuition be delayed in any way, or can we expect them as usual?\"\nHelble:\nWe anticipate making decisions around the award of financial aid on the usual schedule, and that will be managed through the usual process, through our financial aid office. We recognize the demonstrated need will be changing and will be increasing, and as I said, we are committed to meeting that need. The process will not be changing.\nAnderson:\nAnd in terms of a return to work, you've covered a lot of different aspects of how and when we will be making decisions about the return. I do have a question in here about Dartmouth staff who work at the medical center, and how decisions are being made about when they will be able to return to work.\nHelble:\nThat's a good question, Justin, and the honest answer is, I don't have an answer to that question. That's a question for me to put to the task force. Because they are physically working at the Medical Center, I imagine that that would be guided substantially, and perhaps entirely by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center return to work rules, but anything in a research laboratory will need to be done consistent with the guidance from the workforce. So we can put that question to Josh. It might actually be better to, if it's a research laboratory question, bring that question back when we have Dean Madden with us, the vice provost for research next week.\nAnderson:\nAnd here's another one that might be better addressed to say, Lisa Adams, Josh's co-chair but, but I'm going to ask you anyway, because I think it's a pretty good question. \"How are community members with compromised immune systems or other health concerns going to be treated by these new policies for returning to work in school? Specifically, how will students with health concern access equitable education when they might not be able to return to campus at the same time as their peers?\"\nHelble:\nYeah, that's a question Justin, that's going to need to be answered on an individual basis. It's a question that's relevant for members of our faculty and staff, it's a question that's certainly relevant for many members of our student community. And so there, I can say we are conscious of the need to offer everyone equitable access, we are conscious of the need to protect the health of every member of our community. That means every student, and every member of the faculty and staff. And so, we will be working with students on an individual basis as we can, and we will also be providing guidance to make sure that any students who are in the situation such as the one you just described, are not put in a situation where they are uncomfortable or jeopardizing their health, simply by coming to school.\nAnderson:\nSo I think we have time for one more question for you, Joe. The bulk of the questions that are coming in, really are about the belongings, but one interesting question that has come in is, \"What do you believe will be the biggest challenge facing staff when they return?\"\nHelble:\nThe biggest challenge facing staff when they return? I think the biggest challenge facing staff is the same as the challenge facing faculty, and in some ways, facing students as well. It's adjusting to a work environment that's different than the work environment that we all left. We had to make a significant transition when we went to remote learning, and remote working, and remote teaching.\nWhen we come back to campus, we know, without my being able to tell you the specifics today, we know that there will be different protocols in place for distance that individuals need to keep from one another. We know that there will be protocols in place where we need to be very attentive to cleaning of materials and equipment around us. We know that we are going to need to be interacting in meetings and in physical spaces in different ways. And we know that we are going to be needing to be thinking about things like wearing masks, perhaps in meetings, perhaps whenever we're at an indoor environment, we have not yet made decisions on some of those kinds of questions. And I think for all of us, that's going to be an adjustment and a new challenge as we return to work. It's not going to be exactly the way it was when we left, and that's going to take some getting used to.\nSo thank you, Justin, thanks to everyone who wrote in with questions, and given the great interest in discussing belongings, and given that I think they both have something important to say, why don't we turn to Dean Kathryn Lively and VP Josh Keniston. So Kathryn, Josh, good to have you with us this afternoon. I'm going to ask you a few questions to get the conversation started, and then I think you've already heard, there's tremendous interest from our viewers today in putting questions directly to you, and Justin will moderate that conversation. So I'd like to start, Kathryn, with you, and just give you a chance, since not everyone will have seen the email that you sent out this morning describing the process for returning student belongings. At a high level, what's in the plan?\nKathryn Lively:\nSo there's a lot in the plan. As you might imagine, it's a very complicated plan. And so, for the individuals who did receive the email, I would recommend that you hold onto it and that you read it very closely, perhaps more than once. It's a two-pronged plan, we obviously need to take care of our seniors first. They are on much shorter time horizons when they need to get their things back. Many are starting jobs or internships in other places, and so we're starting there. We're going to begin by packing and shipping the materials for seniors first. We are going to be reaching out to all students over the next few days, again, starting with seniors first, and to allow them to indicate on the form, what their options are, like what would they prefer? Some students have already reached out and said, \"I don't want my stuff back,\" other students want it now.\nAnd so, one of the things that we're going to ask students to do is to give us their preference, how would they like to get their things back, with the caveat being if you have large things in your room for seniors, say, I don't know, a Maytag washer, for example, or a futon, those things will be going in storage locally, and you will have a year, and that will be a rolling deadline. So there'll be a rolling deadline for you to come get those possessions at your convenience, which will be orchestrated with the College. Everything else, for the most part, can be shipped, and that is assuming that you want it. And so, keep in mind that you'll have the option to work individually with the people who will be moving your things.\nWe will then, once we get the seniors taken care of, and we would expect most graduating students will have all of their possessions, except those larger items, back by mid-June at the latest, and then we will start the process with our other returning students. Again, each student will be given the option of keeping things here in storage, or receiving it where they are. The process is a little more complicated for international students, due to things like customs and things like that, we'll be working with them as well individually. And I know based on questions that I have received from students who are in College-owned Greek houses, is that the process will work the exact same way for them. We'll be working with students whose possessions are in privately owned Greek houses on an individual basis as well.\nHelble:\nGreat. So thanks so much, Kathryn, and I know that this will go a long way to addressing many of the questions that have been on students' minds since, well, since they left campus in mid-March. So Josh, I'd like to turn to you now. In addition to belongings, the task force has been working on many issues associated with business continuity and continuity of operations for the campus, including the screening protocols that went into effect this week. Can you remind us of what that is, and how those screening protocols were developed?\nJosh Keniston:\nYeah, sure, Joe. So the temperature self-assessment that we've been calling it, for short, TSA, which I know probably invokes thoughts of other travel-related things, but in this case, stands for temperature self-assessment, is really something that's been developed over the last week and a half in response to new guidelines that were put out by the state of New Hampshire on May 1st, as part of the stay at home 2.0 order, which is really looking at how do we move from a kind of blunt instrument of everyone has to stay home, to a phase where we start to ease some restrictions, but really need some better mechanisms around tracking, contact tracing, and testing overall.\nAnd so, the temperature self-assessment is really part of that initiative, and it asks those that are coming to campus to do research activities, to work, so its employees, graduate professionals, school students, postdocs that are coming into our administrative and academic buildings, to go online every morning, take their temperature, report their temperature, and then respond to a series of five questions. And it's really just, it's a tool to make sure that everyone is screening themselves, monitoring themselves on a daily basis before they come to campus. Again, this is something that we'll likely scale up over time. We're really viewing it as a pilot this week, where we have relatively small numbers on campus, and hope to learn from it, so that as we think about bringing more folks on campus over the coming months, that we'll be prepared to welcome folks, and be able to have some of these screening protocols in place.\nHelble:\nAll right, so thank you, Josh. So actually, I'd like to ask you a follow-up question, and I don't know if you heard the exchange, but I'm going to put to you a question that Justin put to me that I couldn't fully answer. As Duane Compton, the dean of the Geisel School often reminds all of us, the research facilities on the Lebanon campus at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center are in fact, Dartmouth research facilities. Do these protocols apply there, and how do we think about return to work guidance for researchers and staff at the DHMC facilities?\nKeniston:\nYeah, so we've kind of taken a matrix approach here. And in some ways, the hospital campus over in Lebanon is a bit ahead of us just because the services that they have to provide and the requirements that they have for their physical spaces have been a bit heightened. So in terms of needing to actually go through this online screening process, those folks who are working over there don't need to do that. The DH campus has its own screening process in place that largely accomplishes the same goals as ours. So we don't need folks to do both.\nBut on the broader question, the process that we're putting in place to ramp up research, as well as to ramp up staff on campus across the board will apply to both campuses, whether you're on the Lebanon campus or the Hanover campus. And it will have the same series of protocols in terms of making sure you have the appropriate approval from the appropriate individuals to do the work that you're doing. And it will really be about how do we slowly ramp this up? How do we make sure that we don't just have kind of flip a switch and have everyone show up on day one, but have a trickle? And so there's a level of coordination that needs to happen there. And so both campuses will be part of that process.\nHelble:\nGreat. Thanks, Josh. That's really helpful and I appreciate your answering that question. So Kathryn, I'd like to turn back to you now. One of the questions that I receive frequently, and I know you do as well, is to ask how students have been engaged in some of the processes and the decision making. And I know that you've been using some structured ways to collect and solicit input from the student community. Could you take a moment or two just to talk about what those have been and how those have helped determine where we've went today?\nLively:\nSure. First of all, I would like to give a quick shout out to the current leadership with Student Assembly and also Palaeopitus. They have been incredibly helpful of gathering all kinds of questions and concerns and comments from the student body and channeling them to the administration in rather large, imposing documents, but with really excellent questions. And, so one of the ways that the students have been able to interact with us in a very structured way is through those mechanisms, is through the traditional student governing bodies. And so I also meet with Student Assembly quite regularly. I've met with them in terms of their leaders, as well as some of their senators as well. I meet regularly with the co-chairs of Palaeopitus. I most recently met with, I wouldn't say all of, about half of Palaeopitus, as well as many of their subcommittee members to make sure that we're capturing some of the concerns of their constituents and to make sure that the work that they've been doing around COVID-19 doesn't get lost in the transition of leadership.\nI've also been working with students, not really working with, but meeting with students during my office hours. I'm doing virtual office hours, which I must admit, are much more popular than my face to face office hours were when we were all still on campus. I know that President Hanlon also still has office hours. And these are all ways that students have been able to reach us through structured mechanisms. However, I've also been meeting with students individually, as well as groups of students who have particular issues that they're concerned about that they would like to get in front of the task force. And all of those conversations have been very helpful. Many student affairs staff are populating many of the working groups that we're on. So it's very easy for me to get the questions, collate them, and then either get them directly to the task force or to get them directly to the relevant working groups. There was one other thing I was going to say.\nHelble:\nLet me ask you, well, go ahead, but let me ask you a follow up question then if that thoughts escaped you. So one of the things you had mentioned to me recently is there were some plans for a student survey that your office was involved in. I don't know if that's what you were about to mention. But if not, could you take a moment to comment on that?\nLively:\nYes, actually. So last night, we sent out what we would consider the modified Dartmouth health survey. So typically, we conduct the Dartmouth health survey every other spring to assess sort of the state of health and wellness on our campus. Last night, actually it was at four o'clock in the afternoon, we invited a random sample of half of all undergraduates, as well as professional students, to take part in a brief modified version of the Dartmouth health survey. And this one was focused specifically on health and wellness during the time of this pandemic. And it captured all kinds of things, including behaviors and attitudes around social distancing recommendations. We need as many students as possible. So if you received the email and you're watching this, please complete the 10 minute survey as soon as possible so that we can obtain the most accurate information about what's going on in terms of student health and wellness this spring. And also so that we can have a better understanding of how students are thinking about public health recommendations around social distancing.\nWhat we're going to do when we receive the data back is to then stand up a working group of students and student affairs staff, as well as potentially some of the members selected through the task force to really work together collaboratively to think about what are the norms? What are the mechanisms? What is social distancing going to look like? What is it going to need to look like so that we can bring students back and to create as safe as an environment as we possibly can in the fall, in the winter, possibly the spring or summer, if this continues to go on?\nHelble:\nGreat. Thanks, Kathryn. That's very helpful. So let me use that as a point to pivot back to you, Josh, and just ask you one or two final questions before we open it up to the broader group. And so it sounds as if, I mean, not sounds as if, clearly the information that the survey that Kathryn described is collecting and then the subsequent work with the students will be helpful to the task force in formulating recommendations. You've got extraordinarily challenging sets of parameters to consider and information to assimilate to provide me and the campus leaders with the information we need to make a decision. And part of this is tied to residence halls, part of it is tied to classrooms. And how are you thinking about those two pieces in that? Which is more challenging? And what kinds of questions are you asking as you help us figure out how to potentially operate in the fall in the presence of COVID-19?\nKeniston:\nYeah. So the which is more challenging is an interesting question. And it really depends on what timeframe. In a lot of ways, the residence halls are initially more challenging because it is a more of a permanent situation. Once we move students in, we have to figure out what's the right way to do that and make sure that that's set up. But then largely, it's the same individuals that are in those spaces. The classrooms, on the other hand, are constantly have people changing in and out of them. And in both of those cases, neither of our systems were designed to be socially distant. In fact, pretty deliberately, we've tried to put as many people into those spaces as possible.\nAnd so we're spending a lot of time with our colleagues in one of our working groups, the health and epidemiology group, thinking about how do we transform our spaces? How do we apply social distancing protocols there? And then in the facility side, how do we apply the appropriate cleaning regimens? There are some recommendations out there in terms of how often surfaces should be cleaned. And so we're looking at how do we ramp up some of the frequency in which we clean some of those common spaces? So it's a bit of a challenge and it's a different way of thinking. We've spent a lot of time thinking about how do we get kind of more people into these spaces? And now we're somewhat doing the opposite. So it's a fine dance to try and figure out how to do it right. But I think we have a good team in place and they're starting to figure out what this could look like for the fall.\nHelble:\nYep. So thank you, Josh. And it's something I hear echoed on other campuses, as you know. I and many of us are in frequent conversations with our peers at our Ivy plus peer institutions and other institutions across New England. And we're hearing the same things, we are grappling with similar issues. And when one thinks about a residential college campus, one immediately thinks about the challenges of safe living in the residence halls and the presence of COVID-19. But in many ways, the shared campus facilities, including classrooms where there's such frequent changeover, are an even bigger challenge for us all to work through. So Justin, let me turn to you, given the broad interest in asking questions of Josh and Kathryn. Why don't you take us through the next set of questions?\nAnderson:\nGreat. And just dive right in. And Kathryn, I'll start with a question for you. Question is regarding Dean Lively's email, could she please expand on what types of items will and will not be shipped for graduating seniors, particularly those who live far away from Hanover and may not be able to return easily? This is a particularly big issue.\nLively:\nI don't know, what I've been told, and this is, my view, more of a question for Josh is that these are that we are going to be storing large items. And again, a washer, a futon, those types of items that would be particularly cumbersome. If the person is absolutely unable to return to campus, I'm not sure what the decision was from the working group on that, Josh. I don't know if that's something that you've come up with, but I can certainly add that to the working group and post that in an updated frequently asked questions.\nKeniston:\nYeah. So I think we'll have to deal with those. The goal right now is to store them and give individuals up to a year. As with a lot of things, as things continue to play out, we'll have to update and revise as we go. But at this point, the plan is to just store those items. And it's large things like sofas, TVs, bikes, those kind of large things that can't easily fit into a box to be shipped.\nAnderson:\nJosh, I'll stay with you for two related questions. The first one is, is it possible to come up to pack my items and to have them shipped by the College? And then the related question is we are from Florida. Can I fly to campus with my student when permitted to pack up the room, bring most of the items home with us, and then store the other large items?\nKeniston:\nYeah. So let me just echo what I think both Kathryn and Joe have said. This is a tricky situation and our solution is not perfect. Even in the best scenario, move out days can be a bit crazy. And so at this point, we're going to provide students options, but we're not going to provide different permutations of options. And that really is just how do we manage 3,200 students coming back? And the logistics of that get really complicated, really, really fast. So students that would like to come to campus will have an opportunity in July to do that, assuming things continue to progress on the public health perspective. But those who come will need to take their belongings. Or you can select to have your belongings stored or shipped.\nAnderson:\nWell, and Josh, you mentioned July. And there are a fair amount of questions about that. Specifically, will there be restrictions on who gets to return to campus to pick up their belongings in July? And basically, what is that process and what would that actually look like for that period in July if and when people are able to return to campus?\nKeniston:\nSo the restrictions that we're going to put on place are based off of number of people. And again, this is really about trying to limit how many people are on campus and needing to provide that social distancing space. So those will be specific limits that we put in place. And then we're really going to look to follow the best public health guidance. And so it is certainly going to be more challenging for those who are further away, but to the extent that the guidance that the CDC and others are putting out allows for folks to safely travel, we're not going to put additional limits on them.\nAnderson:\nJoe, if you don't mind, I'd like to come back to you with a question. This is about belongings, but I think he may be better situated to answer this question. Wouldn't it be better for students to know what the fall plan is so that they can decide how to retrieve their possessions?\nHelble:\nThat's a good question. And so we are committed to making our decision for fall term, as I said, by the end of June. I think certainly Josh and the task force and I can take up that question if it would be in some students' interests to wait until July to make a decision. I don't want to commit the task force, but I suspect we may be able to accommodate that. If we are focusing on returning the belonging of seniors first, then returning the belongings to seniors is not dependent upon any decision about fall term. Josh can correct me, but I am pretty sure that's going to take us a good ways into June. At that point, we're very close to making a decision on fall term. And so I think it may work out that students will know what their fall term plans are or what the fall term plans are before they need to commit to retrieving their belongings one way or another. And I think Josh and the task force and I can take that up, but we would certainly like students to, as he said, it would be challenging for us to provide many different permutations on the options. Having said that, we would like to give people as much information as we possibly can when they need to make a decision.\nAnderson:\nJosh, I got sort of a followup to the July question in real time here, So I'm just going to give this question to you. Can you clarify that if a student chooses to return to campus in July, the student will be able to pack their own belongings and that those belongings must be taken by the student, i.e. the College will not store or ship.\nKeniston:\nYeah. So the exact process for July is going to take a little bit of work for us to figure out so I can't guarantee anything on those fronts. At this point, the concept is really around students being able to come and retrieve their belongings in July. I think it's a fair question for us to look at the storage thing. So I'll take that back to the working group out of this call.\nLively:\nSo my understanding of the process is that students will not be allowed to pack their own things. And so that all things have been left in residence halls will be packed by packers and that even students who come back in July with family members to pick up things, that they will actually be picking up boxes from a location, from a central location.\nAnderson:\nKathryn, if I can stay with you about packing of the belongings, I have a question. What is the training or the qualifications of the people who will be doing the packing. As a student, I have concerns about damage, and we'd like to know what steps will be taken to minimize potential damage.\nLively:\nWe're beginning the process and we may be able to continue the process throughout with professional packers, and there will be a reimbursement if there anything is lost or damaged. And importantly, on the form that students will be receiving, if there are certain items that they have, that they are concerned about, they will be able to identify what those are in special care will be taken with those particular items.\nAnderson:\nOne of those items, Kathryn, I'll just stay with you. One of the items that people are asking about are cars. What about student vehicles, specifically in A lot, will the College pay to return vehicles, provide parking and A lot indefinitely. Can a student come pick up their car? If so, when? So a lot of questions about cars that are still here for students who are not.\nKeniston:\nYeah. So at this point, again, this falls to the category of extremely bulky items. And so at this point, the plan around vehicles is really are on that July timeframe. So for offering students to come back and pick up their belongings, we would also in July allow for students to return to campus to pick up their cars, to the extent that they need to stay in A lot, and again, this is kind of across the board, we aren't currently charging for parking for faculty and staff that are on campus, so we'll be flexible on that front. And this is one that we'll have to see how things evolve. At this point, our hope is that most folks who need to come and pick up a car will be able to do that in July, or will be back with us at some point in the coming year to be reunited. But to the extent that there are some one off scenarios that that doesn't work, we'll continue to work with those students to figure it out.\nAnderson:\nJosh, if I could stay with you a question about, on campus apartments. For students living in, say the river apartments, how will belongings be divvied up and shipped? Can we FaceTime with someone to sort out belongings or will we have to return to campus to get our belongings at some in the future?\nKeniston:\nSo the form is going to be sent out is going to take a first crack at this and provide an opportunity for those in shared spaces to provide some descriptions around how things should be divvied up. We're going to look at what we get coming back from that, and then figure out what else we can do. At this point, we don't think we're going to be able to offer kind of a FaceTime situation for everyone, the logistics of that are difficult. But we do know that there are shared spaces where belongings they're going to have to be divvied up, and so we will work with students to figure that out. And right now the kind of first step there is to fill out the form that will be emailed.\nLively:\nJust to know, we're also aware that students have items in multiple locations across campus, both in offices, and that they've left where if they are a class officer, or if they're a reporter for The D or someone like that. And so those types of questions about where are your things located in and outside of your room will also be available in the forum.\nAnderson:\nYeah. A lot of questions are sort of about the shared space issue and how are the packers going to be able to figure out what item belongs to which person, particularly if the room happens to not be very neatly organized, which I can't imagine wouldn't be the case. Another question for you, Kathryn, this is an interesting one. I was on an LSA for winter term and all of my belongings are in on campus storage. Will the College ship those belongings to me?\nLively:\nYes. I would imagine that again, unless it's a washer or a futon, so I would imagine it would follow the same processes, that larger items would be stored and things that are already boxed and packaged would be shipped. If that is the student's preference.\nAnderson:\nJosh, a number of questions about Greek houses specifically, will belongings need to be removed from the fraternity houses as well as residence halls.\nKeniston:\nSo for the College to own facilities, the goal is to get those belongings either packed or shipped or removed. For those that are not College-owned, we'll be coordinating with those organizations to figure out what the right next steps are there.\nAnderson:\nAnd then a question about costs, Kathryn. Do students have to pay for the storage?\nLively:\nNo. The College is covering the costs of the shipping and storage.\nAnderson:\nOkay. We are thankfully able to get through a lot of questions. Couple more. And you've kind of answered this, but I think it's worth asking again, can students get in touch with the individuals and, or be notified who will be cleaning out their rooms?\nKeniston:\nAt this point, it's unlikely that they will have kind of direct content, but we will have a process. Again, it starts with this form for students to indicate important items and to flag issues. And then there will be a followup process. So if things are shipped, if there will be emails that go out. Again, the number of rooms and students here require us to have some level of efficiency in our process, but we'll make pay close attention to making sure the process is tight and that we're communicating throughout. And that there are some back and forth opportunities.\nAnderson:\nKathryn, you mentioned several times that the particularly large items that will not be able to be shipped, but the question here is will students be told what items theirs were not shipped because they were too big?\nLively:\nYes, students should be receiving an inventory of what is not been able to be shipped and what is being put in storage. Again, we hope to be able to provide students as much optionality as possible.\nAnderson:\nWe have time for just one more question and Josh, I'm going to send this one your way. What are considered to be prohibited items?\nKeniston:\nSo, the College policy on weapons is the best place to look. And so I think Justin, the question is, what are the prohibited items that will be compensated by safety and security? And so it's, again, we're not doing searches, we're there to pack. But for certain things like weapons, for lots of reasons, in terms of shipping regulations and storage regulations, and what have you, those items will be taken into possession by safety and security and stored by them.\nAnderson:\nGot it. Well, I have no doubt that more questions are going to keep coming in and that many of you are going to have questions that perhaps will occur to you later on. I encourage you to visit the COVID-19 Dartmouth webpage. You can get to it from the Dartmouth homepage. Lots of information available on that page and importantly, there's also an email address to which you can send any questions that you have, and we will get back to you as soon as we possibly can with an answer. So thank you so much for all of the questions that you sent in. I hope that this was helpful. This is a really complicated issue, and I want to thank Kathryn and Josh for tackling it, and also coming here to tackle some of these questions. Joe?\nHelble:\nThank you, Justin. And let me add my thanks to Kathryn and Josh into everyone in student affairs and everyone on the task force and the associated working groups, who's been working on this issue for quite some time. And I think the questions that we received today, and more questions I know to follow, illustrate the enormous complexity of the challenge, and clearly the importance to all the members of our student community who are quite eager to have us work through this and give them the opportunity to retake ownership of their possessions. So we're committed to working with each of you to make that happen.\nThanks everyone for joining us again today, I hope the conversation around this and other issues has been helpful. We will be back next week to discuss in more detail the process for the gradual reopening of our research laboratories. Vice Provost for Research Dean Madden will be joining me, as will one or two members of our faculty, whose research laboratories have been conducting some work related to COVID-19 during the period of the campus shut down. The following week, I will be joined by President Hanlon and Chair of the Board of Trustees Laurel Richie to discuss some of the issues that they've been engaged with in working with us on, as we work through all things related to COVID-19. So until next week, thanks very much everyone be healthy and be safe, and we look forward to next week's community conversation with you all. Thank you.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/community-conversations-may-13-2020-transcript"},
{"title": "Community Conversations: Returning Student Belongings", "text": "Watch the May 13 Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and guests Dean of the College Kathryn Lively and COVID-19 Task Force Co-Chair Josh Keniston.\nIn this week's Community Conversations broadcast, Provost Joseph Helble spoke with Dean of the College Kathryn Lively and Vice President for Institutional Projects Josh Keniston about how Dartmouth plans to reunite approximately 3,200 students with belongings left behind when the campus closed for residential learning at the end of winter term.\nHelble, Lively, Keniston, and other campus leaders have been tackling the issue \"almost from the moment that students left campus in mid-March,\" said Helble, who spoke from the Starr Studio in the Dartmouth Library's Baker-Berry Library. \"We understand its importance to our community, and even though it was a relatively simple question\u2014how will belongings be returned?\u2014as I'm sure many can imagine, the details and logistics were extraordinarily complex.\"\nEarlier in the day, Lively had sent an email to students detailing a plan for returning belongings over the course of the summer, first to graduating seniors and then to other undergraduates. Professional packers will pack all items, and, with a few exceptions, students will have the option to have these stored or shipped to them at Dartmouth's expense. By the end of this week, students will receive a questionnaire on which they can indicate their preferences and any special requests, and staff members will follow up as needed.\n\"There's a lot in the plan, as you might imagine,\" Lively said. \"I would recommend that you read it very closely, perhaps more than once.\"\nToday's broadcast was the third in a series of Community Conversations, a weekly online forum for members of the Dartmouth community to ask questions and get updates from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNext week, Helble will speak with Vice Provost for Research Dean Madden about plans to ramp up on-campus research this summer. On May 23, President Philip J. Hanlon '77 and Trustee Chair Laurel Richie '81 will join Helble.\nHelble began this week's broadcast with a discussion of the timeline and decision-making process for reopening facilities; plans to reinstitute grades for remote summer term courses; the process for determining how many students, faculty, and staff may be able to safely return to campus for the coming fall term; and how the roll-out of new health screening guidelines for those working on campus might be broadened to allow more faculty, staff, and students on campus. (The guidelines are available on Dartmouth's COVID-19 website.)\nFor all of these decisions, maintaining the health and safety of the Dartmouth and Upper Valley committees is paramount, he said.\nHe also thanked alumni and other members of the community who have donated more than $185,000 to an emergency relief fund for students. \"That fund has been fully allocated by the financial aid staff according to their normal process for determining student financial needs,\" he said.\nRegarding research, Helble said he expects an announcement by the middle of next week on initial plans to gradually resume research in laboratories that have been closed since mid-March. But he urged patience with the process.\n\"It won't be business as usual in all research laboratories immediately at the beginning of June. It will be a slow and gradual ramp up,\" he said.\nAs previously announced, a decision about whether\u2014and how many\u2014students, faculty, and staff can return to campus for the fall term will come by June 29, based on the recommendations of a joint working group that includes leaders and experts from Dartmouth and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.\n\"There are two high-level questions that they are helping us work through,\" Helble said. \"First, what is the maximum number of students that we can host in a residential learning environment beginning in fall term. And second, a higher-level question: whether we should focus on fall term alone in our planning, or we should step back and think of the entire academic year as our planning horizon.\"\n\"We will, as with other decisions, be methodical and thorough and thoughtful and data-driven,\" Helble said. \"There are no shortcuts to getting to a thoughtful decision.\"\nHelble was joined via Zoom from other locations by Lively and Keniston, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force, to field viewer questions about student belongings and other issues, in a conversation moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to the Starr Studio.\nAsked how she and her team have been in contact with students this term, Lively said, \"I would like to give a quick shout out to the current leadership in Student Assembly and Palaeopitus (a senior society). They have been incredibly helpful in gathering all kinds of questions and concerns and comments from the student body and channeling them to the administration.\"\nKeniston talked about the new health screening guidelines that require staff, faculty, and students currently working on campus to take their temperature daily and answer a set of questions about their health.\n\"It's a tool to make sure that everyone is monitoring themselves on a daily basis before they come to campus,\" he said. \"We're really viewing it as a pilot this week, where we have relatively small numbers on campus. We hope to learn from it, so that as we think about bringing more folks on campus over the coming months, we'll be prepared to have some of these screening protocols in place.\"\nHe also noted that Dartmouth employees who work at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center should follow the medical center's protocols for returning to their workplaces.\nHelble answered questions about plans to reopen the Dartmouth Child Care Center\u2014a decision that depends on state guidelines, he said\u2014and financial aid decisions for summer and fall terms.\n\"We recognize that demonstrated need will be increasing, and we are committed to meeting that need,\" Helble said, noting that the timeline for applying for and receiving financial aid has not changed.\n\"These are challenging and unprecedented times for all of us,\" Helble said. \"I ask for and thank you for your support of one another as members of the Dartmouth community as we find our way forward.\"\nCommunity Conversations air Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. through spring term.

{"title": "Community Conversations: Salaries Extended Through July 31", "text": "Watch the June 3 Community Conversation with Provost Joseph Helble and guests Executive Vice President Rick Mills and Lisa Adams, co-chair of the COVID-19 task force.\nProvost Joseph Helble began the June 3 Community Conversations broadcast by acknowledging that this has been \"an extraordinarily challenging week for our country\"\u2014a reference to the protests against racism and police brutality that have captured the attention of the nation and the world.\nCiting a May 31 community email from President Philip J. Hanlon '77 that condemned \"the deplorable acts of violence against black men and women, and the structural forms of racism that lead people of color to disproportionately shoulder the burdens of poverty and inequality,\" Helble said the events of the past week have led him to ask himself what he\u2014and Dartmouth\u2014can do better \"to make sure every student on this campus, every member of the faculty, every member of the staff is welcomed, supported trusted, respected, and honored as an individual.\"\nHelble then turned to discuss more operational matters\u2014the purpose of the Community Conversations series\u2014and announced that Dartmouth is extending its commitment to pay all employee salaries through July 31. Previously, the institution had committed to paying salaries through the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.\nThe decision gives Dartmouth time to finalize its operational decisions about the coming academic year, which will be announced by June 29, he said. \"Given that we will not be making decisions on fall term until the end of June, and given the link between operations and budget, we are extending that broad commitment for another month.\"\nExecutive Vice President Rick Mills, one of the guests on the broadcast, said he understands employees' anxiety about the future. As administrators and the COVID-19 task force consider different models of education for fall term, they are at this point uncertain about fall staffing levels.\n\"A lot of our planning is trying to see where those different elements of uncertainty resolve in terms of how many students do we have back? How rapidly are we ramping up, what does the campus look like in the fall? What do we need to be ready to staff for? And I think once we know some of those parameters, we'll have a clearer picture of what the forward future looks like in terms of financial circumstances and employment.\nHelble discussed the Office of Admissions' announcement today making standardized test optional for applicants to the Class of 2025. The decision comes follows an advisory from the College Board, which administers SAT tests, warning of the challenges of providing safe testing facilities to students in densely populated cities.\n\"To clarify, optional truly means optional,\" Helble said. \"We do not want anyone to engage in a guessing game as to whether it will be better to submit a test score. We will not report test scores for the matriculating class of 2025.\"\nIn addition to Mills, Helble was joined by task force co-chair Lisa Adams, associate dean for global health and an associate professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine. Adams and Mills spoke via Zoom from their homes.\nThe three discussed the state of the pandemic in New Hampshire and how that is affecting budgetary decisions for fiscal year 2021 and plans for the upcoming academic year, and answered viewer questions in a conversation moderated by Vice President for Communications Justin Anderson, who spoke from a room adjacent to the Starr Studio in Dartmouth Library's Berry Library, where Helble was situated.\nAdams, an expert in infection diseases, offered some good news: \"Data from New Hampshire and Vermont have shown that both states have essentially flattened their epidemiological curves.\"\nThe promising trend reflects the community's adherence to prevention guidelines, she said. \"All of those things that we've been doing in the Upper Valley\u2014staying at home, wearing face coverings\u2014all of those things have worked.\"\nIn considering whether to allow undergraduate residential life to resume on campus, Adams said Dartmouth is in the process of developing a \"robust model\" for testing faculty, staff, and students for COVID-19 and managing contact tracing. But she emphasized that until there is a vaccine, no amount of testing or contact tracing is a replacement for behavioral changes.\n\"As we think about welcoming more people back to our campus community, I want to think about the social contract that we need to be making about how we take care of each other,\" she said.\nOther topics Helble and his guests addressed:\nDecisions about fall varsity sports are being made at the Ivy League and conference levels, and will be announced over the summer, \"well in advance of when we bring athletes back to be practicing for the fall season,\" Helble said.\nTo help address the challenge of reopening the Dartmouth College Child Care Center, Mills is working to create a parent advisory board so that parents of children who had been in the center can have a voice in the process.\nDartmouth libraries are working toward a phased reopening, anticipated to begin in July.\nCommunity Conversations is a weekly online forum for members of the Dartmouth community to ask questions and learn from campus leaders about the institution's priorities, decisions, and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe show is produced by Dartmouth's Media Production Group and the Office of Communications and airs Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. Past episodes are available on the Community Conversations site, which includes call-in numbers for those who want to listen to the show without video.

But it is now clear that the risk of hosting events of this magnitude in mid-June, with students, families, alumni, and friends from all over the world gathering on the Green in such close proximity, is simply too great a risk to take.\"\nThe 2020 graduates will get their opportunity to celebrate on the Green in June 2021, alongside the 50th reunion Class of 1970, in a ceremony sure to be both poignant and spirited, President Hanlon said.\n\"To the Class of 2020, make no mistake: You will have your day. And that day will be filled with all the pomp and circumstance you so rightly deserve,\" Hanlon wrote. \"Your commencement will take on extra-special meaning for all of us next year.\"\nDegrees will be conferred on June 14 this year in a virtual ceremony, the details of which are still in the works.\nHanlon told alumni expecting to travel to Hanover this summer for reunions that the alumni relations team will work with each reunion class to develop virtual programming in lieu of in-person gatherings.\n\"As an alumnus, I know how important reunions are to all of you,\" he wrote.\nIn mid-March, Dartmouth announced that all undergraduate and graduate spring term classes would be conducted remotely for the 10-week term, which began on March 30. A decision hasn't been made yet on summer term, which begins on June 25.

This kind of change, of such extraordinary magnitude and in such a short period of time, is challenging for every member of our community,\" wrote Helble.\nSophomores traditionally take classes on campus in what's called \"sophomore summer.\" The current sophomores will be given the opportunity to spend the summer of 2021 on campus taking classes, said Helble.\n\"We have heard from alumni and older students alike how fondly they recall (the sophomore summer) experience.

The current spring term ends June 4, with the conferring of degrees to graduating students to be held online June 14. Planning for the degree-granting program is currently in the works. As with sophomore summer, the 2020 graduates will be invited to campus in June of 2021 for a commencement celebration.\nHopkins Center programming will continue to take place online through the summer in the Hop@home series.\nHelble wrote that he and members of Dartmouth's COVID-19 task force waited until now to make a decision about summer term, hoping that there would be a way to hold classes on campus.\n\"We waited as long as was practical to find out whether the spread of the virus had peaked, whether the predictive modeling matched the data, and whether state and federal governments could offer updated guidance that might allow residential education to resume,\" he wrote. \"Unfortunately, after several weeks of careful consideration, we have concluded that the facts are not in our favor.\"\n\"A residential summer term relying on social distancing and severe restrictions on activities and gatherings would pose a significant public health risk to our students and to our faculty and staff, their families, and the Upper Valley community.\"\n\"Put simply, given the continuing progression of the disease, a wide geographic disparity in its containment, the continuing lack of adequate testing capability, and no widespread effective treatment, with the health and safety of our community being of paramount importance we cannot offer a residential summer term.\"\nFaculty and staff will continue to work remotely through the summer when possible, Helble wrote, adding that in late spring and early summer Dartmouth officials will explore scenarios for fall term and consider when to restart on-campus operations, based on state and federal guidance.\nAlmost all students left for home in March, with approximately 180 undergraduates who could not return to their homes remaining on campus. A small number of staff have continued to work on campus, providing take-out food for the on-campus residents and maintaining buildings and other campus properties.\n\"To those employees who remain working on campus, we extend our gratitude and appreciation,\" Helble wrote. \"I remain inspired by the way our faculty and staff have remained focused on our students' education, and how our students have responded with understanding and compassion for the faculty and staff working on their behalf. These collective efforts and sacrifices, while difficult for all, are keeping our families, friends, and neighbors safe.

{"title": "Hanlon: Pandemic Calls for Financial Aid Response", "text": "In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, Dartmouth is strengthening its effort to ensure access to a liberal arts education for all students, regardless of their ability to pay, President Philip J. Hanlon '77 announced on May 14.\nPresident Hanlon outlined a plan of urgent action that encompasses all of Dartmouth's schools, to benefit undergraduates and graduate students. The plan includes a new goal to expand the family-income threshold for a full-tuition undergraduate scholarship to $125,000, a renewed emphasis on annual giving, creation of a special scholarship bridge fund, and increasing Dartmouth's endowed scholarships.\nCalling the global pandemic and economic downturn \"our leadership moment,\" Hanlon pledged that the College community will not waver from its commitment to uphold need-blind admission practices for undergraduates while meeting the full demonstrated financial need of all new and continuing students regardless of citizenship.\nSpeaking in an online community meeting attended by more than 550 alumni and parent volunteer leaders, the president described the economic toll of the past two months, noting that, in the face of unprecedented national unemployment that is clearly impacting Dartmouth families, a surging number of appeals have been received by the College's Office of Financial Aid from current and accepted students during the past eight weeks.\n\"Families from all financial backgrounds are wondering whether they can attend\u2014or return to\u2014Dartmouth next year without additional scholarship support and we are committed to responding to that new and urgent need,\" said Hanlon. \"Our mission, so critical to our nation and our world, is grounded in the premise that talent, drive, and promise are distributed equally among us. Here, students from across the globe and from every socioeconomic background leap into a crucible of ideas, values, cultures, and beliefs often entirely different from their own. The society we become tomorrow will be led by the students we educate today.\"\nHanlon announced the establishment of the Presidential Commission on Financial Aid to study the impact of the crisis on higher education, given the historic role of scholarships as an agent of opportunity and social mobility. The commission will be co-chaired by accomplished Dartmouth volunteer leaders Leslie Dahl '85 and Bob Dahl P'18 and Julie McKenna '89 and David McKenna '89, P'18, '24.\n\"Julie, Dave, Leslie, and Bob honor Dartmouth with their belief in this urgent enterprise,\" said chair of the Dartmouth Board of Trustees Laurel Richie '81. \"By enlisting their leadership, the president has identified individuals who have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to creating educational opportunity and who bring the best of themselves to every undertaking.\"\nScholarship Need of Historic Proportions\nDartmouth anticipates an increase of $8 million to $10 million more in undergraduate scholarships for the next academic year beyond the budget already approved by the Trustees of $120 million\u2014an unprecedented one-year increase. The College forecasts a similar increase in the following academic year, for a total of $16 million to $20 million in additional financial aid need during the next two fiscal years.\nThe expected surge in scholarship need is emerging as Dartmouth takes a series of measures to reduce costs in the face of anticipated combined operating losses of up to $100 million by June 30, the close of fiscal 2020. Actions to date include a freeze on hiring through December, cancellation of salary increases for the next fiscal year, and multiple targeted spending reductions\u2014and Hanlon said the College will announce more cost-saving measures in the coming weeks. He noted that he had committed 20 percent of his salary in support of the Dartmouth College Fund.\nReducing expenditures, however, will not be enough, said Hanlon. Despite the economic crisis, he said, the Dartmouth community is rising to the challenge.\n\"We've worked far too hard to achieve socioeconomic diversity in our student body and we've seen how deeply it enriches our campus. To back down now from our commitment to need-blind admissions and meeting full need of our students would be tragic,\" said Hanlon. \"To the contrary, now is a time to show, to the students and families yearning for the chance to succeed, that our commitment is stronger than ever.\"\nPhilip J. Hanlon '77 talks to students During matriculation in 2016, members of the Class of 2020 gathered in Parkhurst to sign the Dartmouth Citizenship Pledge and speak with President Philip J. Hanlon '77. (Photo by Eli Burakian '00)\nThe Presidential Commission\nOne of only a few presidential commissions to be convened in Dartmouth's 250-year history, the commission will advise the president on a wide range of issues related to financial aid, including an in-depth appreciation for student and family need, insight into the economic forces that inform college decisions, and efforts to enhance the effectiveness of Dartmouth's financial aid resources in supporting student success.\nThe commission will work closely with the president and Provost Joseph J. Helble to mobilize the Dartmouth community around a shared commitment to access and affordability and champion fundraising efforts to raise the remaining $300 million for The Call to Lead campaign's financial aid initiatives.\n\"Ensuring that our students have the resources they need has always been a Dartmouth priority, a challenge made more pressing due to current economic conditions,\" said Leslie Dahl. \"This priority is a cornerstone of the Dartmouth experience for all students.\"\nDave McKenna said ensuring a bright future for all Dartmouth students\u2014those already enrolled and prospective students hoping to attend\u2014is at the heart of the commission's work.\n\"We're in this together if we choose to be. And at Dartmouth, we choose to be,\" he said. \"The bottom has fallen out unbelievably fast for many families. Dinner table conversations for these families have gotten increasingly tough and desperate. But a transformative Dartmouth education should not fall victim to COVID-19.\"\nA Financial Aid Plan to Bridge the Crisis\nHanlon outlined a plan that will open the promise of Dartmouth to more students globally and eliminate their financial obstacles to attendance. With the College's longstanding commitment to meet 100 percent of students' demonstrated financial need for all four years, the College announced a goal of expanding the income threshold for a full-tuition scholarship from $100,000 to $125,000; eliminate loans from all financial aid awards; and become one of only six colleges and universities in the United States to guarantee need-blind admissions to non-U.S. citizens.\nTo realize this plan to benefit all five schools across the campus by 2023, the campaign will seek support for financial aid through three priority programs:\nA renewed emphasis on annual giving, including the Dartmouth College Fund and the Parents Fund, which together provide approximately half of all financial aid awarded to undergraduates.\nCreation of a special $20 million scholarship bridge fund that will enable Dartmouth to meet the unprecedented increase in financial aid need during each of the next two academic years.\nA heightened focus on endowed scholarship funds, which will strengthen and distinguish Dartmouth's financial aid offerings. The Call to Lead campaign has a $500 million goal for endowed scholarships. Through the generosity of hundreds of donors, the College to date has secured approximately $204 million toward that target.\n\"This is an extraordinarily bold undertaking in extraordinarily difficult times. But this is what Dartmouth does best,\" said Hanlon. \"When crisis strikes, we roll up our sleeves and ask how we can help. We pull together as a community for what we know is important and right. And we will need the help of every single member of the extended Dartmouth family to make it happen.\"\nFor further information, please go to https://calltolead.dartmouth.edu/", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/05/hanlon-pandemic-calls-financial-aid-response"},
{"title": "Dartmouth Labs Put COVID-19 Research on the Fast Track", "text": "As the novel coronavirus takes its deadly toll, there's potentially life-saving activity going on night and day at Dartmouth.\n\"Whether developing or deploying new testing strategies, laying the groundwork for antibody-based therapeutics, or contributing personal protection equipment, the Dartmouth research community is already making the fight against this novel coronavirus our own,\" says Dean Madden, vice provost for research.\nHere are a few of the many research projects under way.\nTesting, Testing\u2026\nDavid Leib, a virologist and professor and chair of microbiology and immunology at the Geisel School of Medicine, is working with colleagues across campus, around the country, and the world to validate a new and improved test for the disease caused by the coronavirus. He is married to Audra Charron, the lead scientist for the lab's COVID-19 diagnostic validation study. Results from the study are already coming in and look very promising. As a result the work is moving toward emergency FDA approval and use in the clinic.\n\"It's taken the U.S. a long time to wake up to this crisis and now we're playing massive catch up,\" says Leib. \"There's an enormous backlog of people that needed to be tested, and what we're now learning is that we actually should be testing asymptomatic individuals as well those with symptoms. Really and truly, in a pandemic of this nature, rigorous, rapid, and open access to testing is key.\"\nBut Leib says two major obstacles stand in the way of safer, more effective, more widespread testing. The test currently approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relies on an extraction agent, which isolates the RNA of the virus. Those agents are in short supply, Leib says. In addition, kits are in short supply, and current testing takes about seven hours, and for testing patients during hospital intake, time is especially of the essence.\nFortunately, says Leib, a company in California is attacking those problems: At Atila Biosystems, CEO Youxiang Wang has developed a new test that could be a powerful weapon in the fight against COVID-19.\n\"Wang's test is unique because it eliminates the need for an extra step to extract RNA from the virus,\"says Leib. \"It's also unique in that it's very rapid, taking less than an hour to get results. It is also sensitive, simple, relatively cheap, and provides some advantages of safety for the testing staff.\"\nBut it hasn't yet been compared head to head with the FDA-approved CDC test now in use. That validation is now being done in Leib's lab by Audra Charron. \"Working alone, because of social distancing requirements, she's performing real-time reactions using the kit from Atila on purified COVID-19 viral RNA and blinded clinical specimens obtained from Joel Lefferts at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock clinic,\" says Leib.\nCharron is testing three kinds of samples. Some are from patients who tested positive for COVID-19; others who have a different virus; and still others are from healthy people. \"We do not know which samples are from sick, and which from healthy patients, and we run those specimens through the Atila test. We then un-code the samples and compare the Atila test with CDC test to see if the results match,\" says Leib. \"We're really testing one test against another.\"\nLeib says universities across the world are banding together in efforts like these. His lab has joined an international, interdisciplinary coalition founded by a nonprofit group based in Israel. Besides Dartmouth, members include the Cleveland Clinic and the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"We're getting enormous help from Geisel, DH, and the Provost's office,\" says Leib. \"They've helped us to scale regulatory hurdles to keep us on a fast track.\"\nPartnering With the N.H State Lab\nAnother team from Geisel and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center has been improving diagnostic methods currently in use locally. Gregory Tsongalis, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and director of the laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technology, says the New Hampshire State Lab was initially overwhelmed with the demand for tests, so D-H verified a high throughput automated test from Abbott laboratories, which is now being used to reduce the state's backlog and test all D-H patients.\n\"We were fortunate to be ahead of the curve with respect to developing internal testing capabilities. We started with the same test as the state lab that was developed by the CDC, and they provided us with positive and negative samples so we could verify testing here at Dartmouth. We have been in close communication with the state lab throughout this process. Our automated testing capabilities allow us to test up to 1,000 samples in 24 hours. Because of this we are available to help the state lab with any overflow of samples they may need us to test, and we can now begin to accept testing from other facilities,\" says Tsongalis. \"We are now running more tests per day than we did in the first week with the system we have in place.\"\nHope for Treatment\nOn the therapeutic front, researchers from Thayer School of Engineering are investigating whether the antibodies that help some people recover from the virus can be turned into medicine for other patients. Jiwon Lee, the Ralph and Marjorie Crump Assistant Professor of Engineering, is an engineer who focuses on the human immune system.\n\"My lab focuses on developing new technologies that allow us to take blood from people whose immune systems have successfully fought off an infection, and determine the amino acid sequences of the different antibody molecules in the blood,\" says Lee. \"For COVID-19, for example, knowing the antibody sequences enables us to test and determine which antibodies are the most effective at neutralizing or preventing the infection.\"\nCollaborating with a group of clinicians, scientists, and engineers from Dartmouth and the University of Texas at Austin, Lee says his lab is trying to understand antibody responses to COVID-19 and identify antibodies with therapeutic potentials.\nIn the meantime, he and other Dartmouth researchers are taking the utmost precautions to stay healthy.\n\"We just cannot get sick,\" Lee says. \"And we cannot delay.\"\nMeanwhile, Dartmouth donors are also stepping up, says Vice Provost Madden, \"providing rapid support to a new series of urgent, high-impact studies of the virus and its impact across our communities.\"\nFor the latest information on Dartmouth's response to the pandemic visit the COVID-19 website.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/04/dartmouth-labs-put-covid-19-research-fast-track"},

Reagan '09 Chair of Policy Studies, is among 175 scholars, artists, and scientists in the United States and Canada awarded fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for 2020.\n\"The Guggenheim Fellowship is an incredible honor,\" Magilligan says. \"It is a recognition of your accomplishments, and also recognition that you're going to try to move the needle in some field, whether it is geography, dance, playwriting, or being a novelist. In some ways, it's hard to process such good news in these times. I'm still in total disbelief.\"\nProvost Joseph Helble says, \"Frank Magilligan's work exploring how science, ecology, and social and political factors influence watershed management is essential not only to the environmental challenges, but also to the political challenges we face as a society. Congratulations to Frank on this recognition of the important contribution his scholarship can make to society.\"\n\"It is gratifying that two Dartmouth scholars this year have been honored in this way,\" Helble added.\nProfessor of Earth Sciences Mukul Sharma was also named a 2020 Guggenheim Fellow.\nGuggenheim fellowships, awarded annually to \"individuals who have already demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts and sciences,\" according to the foundation's website, are intended to encourage creative freedom in leading artists and scholars in the United States.\nThis year the foundation made note of the extraordinary circumstances the awardees are facing as they pursue their work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and noted that the fellowship's founding principle of encouraging creative freedom in leading artists and scholars in the United States is as important now as ever.\nEdward Hirsch, president of the foundation, wrote, \"As we grapple with the difficulties of the moment, it is also important to look to the future. The artists, writers, scholars, and scientific researchers supported by the Fellowship will help us understand and learn from what we are enduring individually and collectively, and it is an honor for the Foundation to help them do their essential work.\"\n'Watershed Moments'\nMagilligan will use the fellowship to complete a book, Watershed Moments: Science, Values, and American Rivers. The project will examine the environmental and biophysical as well as the social, cultural, and political factors that animate contemporary efforts to restore rivers, he says.\n\"This book, with its grounding in both social and natural sciences, will offer readers across the political and disciplinary spectrum the chance to better grasp what's at stake when envisioning our nation's rivers,\" Magilligan says.\nCommunities undertake river restoration projects for many reasons, Magilligan says, sometimes for hazard mitigation such as preventing flooding or stabilizing a channel, but other times for aesthetical or ecological reasons, such as promotion for recreational use or protection of an endangered species.\n\"My goal is to present river restoration not as an outcome but rather as a lens through which to evaluate the structure and dynamics of contemporary environmental conflicts, which themselves reflect deeply embedded struggles over power relations and social change,\" he says.\nMagilligan has been working for decades on the biophysical impact of dams, particularly in Vermont. His hydro-morphological research in the wake of Tropical Storm Irene and more recently on dam removal as a restoration strategy has been widely cited. More recently, with support from the National Science Foundation, Magilligan and Dartmouth colleagues Professor Christopher Sneddon, chair of the geography department, and Senior Lecturer Coleen Fox began looking at the social dimensions of dam removal.\n\"It brought me face to face with local environmental politics,\" Magilligan says. \"We went to dozens and dozens of public meetings and did numerous interviews with opponents and proponents of dam removal and witnessed how contested these debates can be and also how science configures\u2014or not\u2014into the discussion. That got us thinking about the intersection of science, values, and politics. That is the root of what I want to address with this book project. I am extremely grateful for the support the Guggenheim Foundation is providing to support this work.\"\nSharma, Dartmouth's other 2020 Guggenheim recipient, plans to use the Guggenheim fellowship to continue his research on the feasibility of using clay minerals to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester it in the ocean.\nOther Dartmouth faculty who have received Guggenheim fellowships in recent years include, in 2018, Michelle Warren, a professor of comparative literature; Sienna Craig, an associate professor of anthropology; choreographer John Heginbotham, a lecturer in theater and director of the Dartmouth Dance Ensemble; and composer Ashley Fure, an assistant professor of music, in 2017.\nWilliam Platt can be reached at william.c.platt@dartmouth.edu.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/04/frank-magilligan-views-guggenheim-watershed-moment"},
{"title": "Provost: Spring Term Grades Will Be Credit/No Credit", "text": "Spring term grades for undergraduates will change to a credit/no credit system instead of letter grades, Provost Joseph Helble told the Dartmouth community in an email today.\nThe change comes after discussion and consideration of options with academic leaders across campus over the past week, he said.\n\"We recognized that the shift to remote learning will affect our students in many ways,\" he said.\nSpring term classes\u2014all of which will be taught remotely this term due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014will begin March 30. Helble said the change in grading takes into account that students are located around the world, in different time zones, and may have challenges in getting access to online courses.\n\"Some students, particularly those who join the Dartmouth community from regions across the globe, will be challenged by synchronous discussions from a range of time zones. Some will have limited access to bandwidth or to necessary hardware, particularly with the closing of libraries and other public high-bandwidth places across the country. Still others will be living in homes where caregiving and other family demands will affect their ability to work effectively. Some may themselves fall ill. And all will need to rely on teleconferencing for meetings with faculty, peers, and advisers.\n\"While some students may thrive in this distance-learning scenario, we decided that uniform grading, for this term only, was the fairest way to support all of our undergraduate students, and would give our faculty time to focus on the content of their coursework while also providing the opportunity to develop assessments that can be used if remote learning continues into summer term,\" he wrote.\nSpring term courses will not be factored into students' grade-point average and faculty will still have the option of recognizing exceptional work by awarding academic citations.\nAnother change Helble announced is that graduating seniors will not have to pass the swim test or earn a physical education credit if they haven't already done so. This and the grading changes will apply only to spring term, he said, even if some or all of the summer term is taught remotely.\nDartmouth's grading change applies only to undergraduates.

As spring term approaches, Dartmouth wellness experts are offering tools for weathering, and even making the best of, the challenging new circumstances.\n\"This is new to a lot of people. It can make us anxious and uneasy because it's not what we're used to,\" says Courtney Rotchford, Dartmouth's program manager for health promotion and wellness.\nFear about the virus, related changes to daily routines, and general uncertainty, including financial worries, exacerbate people's anxiety and stress levels, says Rotchford, who recommends focusing on what you can control, such as washing your hands frequently and practicing social distancing.\nSocial distancing is something everyone can do right now to have a positive impact on public health, says Caitlin Barthelmes, director of the Student Wellness Center.

Remembering that even the smallest decisions have the power to break the chains of transmission \"can increase our motivation to do our part in keeping the community healthy and give our sacrifices purpose.\"\nIn the meantime, she suggests exploring a variety of strategies for maintaining health and well-being while learning or working from home.\n\"If you're noticing you're not in a great place, you could look at your daily patterns,\" and experiment with more or less structure, or limiting your news intake, says Barthelmes. It's also a good idea to get outside at least once a day.\n\"Spending time in nature can help boost your mood, creating feelings of happiness and well-being, and help you feel more energized when you return to work or studying,\" she says. \"As you navigate the transition, experiment, listen to your gut, and remember you can trust yourself to know what you need.\"\nPlan for Balance\nMaintaining a healthy life-work balance requires planning and discipline when you're studying or working from home.\nWith your computer within easy reach, \"you can just work all the time, and that's not healthy,\" says Rotchford, who recommends creating a separate work or study space in your home, and continuing whatever healthy habits you had already practiced before the pandemic.\n\"If you were in the habit of taking walks, keep doing it,\" Rotchford says. Taking mini breaks to stretch and rehydrate, do a short meditation or breathing exercise, or draw or listen to music \"can really help people regain focus, be less stressed, and more productive.\"\nWith schools and daycares closed, parents of young children face additional challenges.\nThere's no \"magic formula,\" but Rotchford suggests creating a routine for your kids and yourself, and working with your supervisor to determine how to best meet work and family needs. \"I think communication is key right now.\"\nStay in Touch\nMaintaining connections with friends, family, and co-workers during a time of social distancing takes extra effort and creativity. But even brief, regular check-ins can have a big impact, says Sharon Morisi, counselor with the Faculty/Employee Assistance Program. Even if it's just Zoom, \"seeing other people decreases that sense of isolation.\"\nIn these days of social distancing, \"technology can be our friend,\" says Barthelmes. But don't forget about \"the good old phone,\" or even letter writing, especially with family members or neighbors who aren't as tech savvy and may be feeling especially isolated.\nHowever you stay in touch, Barthelmes suggests taking time to applaud the choices people make to protect their well-being and the health of others. \"I'm hoping this opportunity not only brings us together more as a community, but that we feel more connected because we are all working together for the collective good.\"\nIn addition to learning new ways of connecting with one another, having more time at home may also provide a chance to find different ways to connect with the self, which \"is also in a whole different set of circumstances, says Rabbi Daveen Litwin, dean and chaplain of the William Jewett Tucker Center. \"And from where I am sitting, obviously, we talk about a connection to something either within or beyond ourselves, and drawing on those sources of strength, confidence, resilience, and hope, when things are uncertain, and potentially frightening.\"\nBarthelmes notes that while these circumstances are temporary, the knowledge we gain from them need not be.\nIf we use the time to learn about what we need, \"we may walk out of this with a better understanding of how we can be our best selves, how we can be healthy and well,\" and eventually bring some of those practices with us when we return to the workplace or classroom, she says.\nAsk for Help\nIt's natural during times of stress to reach for something that makes us feel better. But as the pandemic unfolds, it's important to pay attention to our moods, and our coping mechanisms, especially when they involve alcohol or other substance use.\n\"Reliance on any addictive substance, including tobacco, caffeine, and cannabis, can prevent us from finding healthier alternatives to coping,\" Barthelmes says. \"It can also lead to chemical dependencies that are even more challenging to change and can negatively impact our mental health.\"\nAlso, people who are prone to depression or anxiety may find their conditions worsening. In that case, Morisi says, it may be helpful to talk to a mental health professional, or ask your PCP whether a medication adjustment is appropriate.\nOther Tips From the Dartmouth Wellness Community", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/03/you-can-trust-yourself-staying-home-staying-well"},

Thank you for all you are doing to safeguard the health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and Upper Valley neighbors,\" they wrote in the second community-wide message sent today.\nEarlier in the day they notified community members that a second student, an undergraduate living in off-campus housing, has tested presumptive positive for the virus. Earlier this week, a graduate student, also living off-campus, tested positive. (A third student's test came back negative.) Both students who tested positive are recovering and Dartmouth officials have checked with them to be sure they are comfortable and have what they need. Dartmouth is also receiving reports of undergraduates in other states who have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nThe changes on campus:\nBy the end of this week, all employees will be working from home unless they have been directed to perform necessary duties on campus. Dartmouth remains open but will be scaling back the number of employees in Hanover. (The College had earlier notified employees that they will continue to pay all regular employees through the end of spring term.)\nDepartments will work with employees to create on-campus rotations to ensure that work is scheduled fairly and to identify duties that can be performed from home to support other Dartmouth work.\nAccess to buildings will be restricted in the coming weeks to only those employees performing necessary duties, including faculty preparing for remote learning during the 10-week spring term, which begins on March 30.\nKeniston and Adams reminded community members that Dartmouth's Faculty/Employee Assistance Program offers support online and by telephone.

Hanlon '77 and Provost Joseph Helble on Wednesday, members of the Dartmouth community had an opportunity to hear directly from senior leaders about Dartmouth's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBy evening, almost 5,000 people had viewed the session, which is available on Dartmouth's YouTube channel.\nThe president and provost outlined efforts Dartmouth has made to date to keep community members safe and curtail the spread of the virus\u2014including, among other actions, shifting spring term classes to a remote learning model, asking staff members whose jobs enable them to work from home to do so, and canceling or postponing in-person events of 10 people or more. (Detailed, up-to-date information about Dartmouth's response can be found at the COVID-19 website.)\n\"To say that we find ourselves in uncharted territory doesn't begin to do justice to the turmoil the COVID-19 pandemic is causing in our lives, for our global community, our nation, and our campus, including all of you,\" Hanlon said, welcoming viewers to \"what I expect will be several virtual town halls in the coming weeks and months.\"\nHanlon acknowledged that Dartmouth \"may not have all the answers at this moment. But please know that we will do our best to address all of your concerns, if not now then as quickly as we possibly can hereafter. For now, I simply want to issue a call for unity and compassion. Let's stand together and help those among us who are most in need. Let's recognize how difficult this is and lift up those among us who are struggling. The Dartmouth family has always been creative, resilient, and determined, and has always found ways to come together in the face of severe challenges. And I know we'll do that again this time.\"\nHelble spoke about the scope of the challenge the pandemic poses and explained the work of the task force charged with planning for and managing disruptions related to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\"I'd like to stress at the outset that we have had our decisions informed by two overriding principles throughout this process,\" Helble said. \"First and foremost is to focus on the health and safety of the community\u2014and by that I mean the full community: students, faculty, staff, and our local neighbors and members of the Upper Valley community. And second, to focus on the continuity of our students' education, on the teaching, learning, and scholarship that constitute our core mission.\"\nMembers of the community had submitted questions on topics ranging from the prospects for holding commencement in June to what Dartmouth is doing to ensure that remote-learning options are as accessible as possible.\nRegarding commencement, Hanlon noted that \"there is a dedicated group looking at the feasibility of going forward, and at alternatives should we not be able to go forward with both commencement and reunion activities.\" He said a decision would be made by April 10.\n\"Commencement and reunions are sacred events for our community\u2014the most important convening of the Dartmouth fellowship, including parents and families and alums each year,\" Hanlon said. \"As such, we will do everything we can to recognize these gatherings and all that they mean if we are unable to go forward with the traditional commencement and reunion.\"\nIn response to several questions about spring-term tuition, Hanlon acknowledged that he has heard many concerns on this issue from students and families. \"We will strengthen financial aid to meet the increased need that we know many students and their families are feeling as a result of this disruption from the pandemic. And obviously, we will not charge room and board for spring term,\" he said.\nAt the same time, he emphasized that Dartmouth's \"commitment to excellent instruction will be no different even if the mode of delivery will be.\"\n\"I am pleased and proud of how quickly and enthusiastically our faculty has embraced the challenge and opportunity of planning for virtual instruction in the spring term,\" he said. \"There will be office hours for every class, arranged by the faculty as with any class. Courses will have group projects as appropriate as they would in any class. It's just that the mode of office hours and group projects will be online or virtual. This may not be perfect, but it will be the differentiated Dartmouth experience.\"\nHelble said that all regular, non-temporary staff, including union staff, will continued to be paid through spring term.\nMembers of the Student Assembly asked whether the available spring courses would fulfill distributive requirements, particularly for seniors in need of a lab or studio-based class. Helble said that course offerings would be finalized by March 26, and that the College would work with all seniors to ensure that they have access to the courses\u2014or reasonable alternatives\u2014they need to graduate.\nAmong other topics Hanlon and Helble addressed at the session:\nHow Dartmouth is safeguarding staff and students still on campus\nHow and when undergraduates may recover personal belongings left behind the residence halls\nAccommodations for students who rely on work study income\nWhether the College will shift to a pass/fail grading system for the spring\nHow postdoctoral students and graduate students will be paid and complete research\n\"I am extremely proud of the way that our community has already come together to try to chart a way forward,\" Hanlon said. \"I know that we will continue to do so, and we will do the best we possibly can as a Dartmouth family under these uncertain circumstances.

In that moment, I realized how isolated I had been feeling. And I expect that many of you are feeling that way too,\" President Hanlon wrote today in an email to faculty, students, and staff about seeing his colleagues in a virtual online meeting of the Office of the President staff.\nHe urged members of the Dartmouth community to check in with co-workers and friends, to have patience and \"empathize before you criticize,\" and to \"strive to stay as positive and productive as possible.\"\nMuch has changed in the last week at Dartmouth as faculty get ready to teach spring term courses remotely, most students have returned home and will begin online classes on March 30, and many employees are working from home.\n\"Fortunately, we are starting from a position of strength,\" Hanlon wrote, praising faculty, students, and staff.\n\"Faculty, you are among the best educators in the world. The wisdom that you will put into course content, the insight you'll include in your lectures as leaders in your fields, the skill you will bring to constructing assignments and group projects, the care you will offer students as they consult with you\u2014all of these things will add to the power of the virtual learning experiences you will offer.\"\nHe applauded students as \"exceptional learners\" who are already well-versed in the technology they'll use to learn remotely. And he thanked staff for the dedication and creativity have they have shown in supporting the changes that are taking place.\n\"This is a challenging time for all of us, and we are doing our best to adapt to this new reality. Every one of us is faced with learning to do familiar tasks in entirely new ways: from teaching and learning, to the work we do for Dartmouth, to how we care for our families and even shop for groceries. It takes mental and psychological energy simply to adjust to this new way of living.\"\n\"I know that all of us\u2014students, faculty, and staff\u2014will strive to stay as positive and productive as possible, and to deliver the very best work we can, given the circumstances.

{"title": "What You Need to Know About Coronavirus", "text": "Dartmouth officials continue to monitor federal and state guidelines concerning the novel coronavirus in order to provide up-to-date information on evolving recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS).\nAs new information becomes available about the virus, this FAQ will be updated.\nDartmouth has a team that meets as an emergency-planning group in cases such as this. Representatives from a number of offices, depending on the situation, take part in the meetings. The current group includes representatives from the offices of the president and provost, safety and security, communications, and offices that deal with foreign travel, programs, and visitors. Dr. Mark Reed, director of the Dartmouth College Health Service, leads the group.\nIt is Dartmouth's goal to ensure the health and safety of the College community. All members will be treated with care and compassion, especially those who fall ill.\nUpdate: Feb. 6, 2020\nImportant consideration concerning spring term travel:\nStudents should be aware that travel waiver requests will not be approved for travel to mainland China or Hong Kong during spring term due to the coronavirus outbreak in China and ongoing civil unrest in Hong Kong. In order to receive academic credit or Dartmouth funds, travelers must have an approved travel waiver for travel to a country identified as requiring a waiver. See the Global Dartmouth website for the most up-to-date information on travel restrictions.\nUpdate: Feb. 4, 2020\nIf you have just returned from China:\nIf you have traveled to locations in mainland China within the past 14 days, even if you do not have a fever or symptoms of respiratory illness such as a cough or shortness of breath, you should isolate yourself for a period of 14 days from your last day of travel in China and monitor yourself for fever and respiratory illness.\nIf you have traveled in the past 14 days to locations in Hubei Province, China\u2014the province where the virus is thought to have originated and which has experienced the most widespread transmission\u2014you should isolate yourself and contact the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services right away at 603-271-4496; after hours, call 603-271-5300. State public health officials will assist you in monitoring your health.\nThis does not apply to individuals who have recently traveled to Hong Kong or Macau.\nHow do I isolate myself?\nSelf-isolation means staying home from school or work; keeping a distance of more than 6 feet from household members or roommates; avoiding public places, especially mass gatherings and events, public transportation, stores, church, parties, etc.; and avoiding further travel until your 14-day monitoring period is over.\nIndividuals who are in self-isolation will ideally have a private room and bathroom, a private entrance, and access to food and other essentials in order to avoid public places such as dining halls.\nWhat if a visitor or other individual coming to campus appears to be ill?\nVisitors experiencing symptoms of illness may be referred, for evaluation, to a local hospital or urgent care clinic for evaluation, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital, and ClearChoiceMD Urgent Care, all of which are located in neighboring Lebanon, N.H.\nShould labs or departments confirm the travel histories or health information of visitors to campus?\nIt is not recommended that independent action be taken to screen visitors for illness or for recent travel history. Dartmouth College Health Service and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center are screening those seeking care. Visitors who feel ill may be referred to a health care center for evaluation. Feel free to share the link to this FAQ with visitors so they are aware of Dartmouth's recommendations and the precautions we are undertaking in accordance with NHDHHS guidance.\nUpdate: Feb. 2, 2020\nDr. Mark Reed this evening sent an email to all faculty, students, and staff notifying the community that a new recommendation from the NHDHHS says that all individuals who have traveled to locations in China should isolate themselves for 14 days from their last day of travel in China. This includes people who have no symptoms of coronavirus. Those who have developed a fever or respiratory illness symptoms within 14 days of travel to China should contact the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services at 603-271-4496.\nSelf-isolation includes avoiding public settings and travel; restricting activities outside of the home, except for medical care; staying in a specific room away from others and using a separate bathroom if possible.\nThe NHDHHS is asking anyone who has traveled within the last 14 days to locations in Hubei Province in China\u2014where the coronavirus is thought to have originated\u2014to contact the state public health office at 603-271-4496 in order to be more actively monitored. This includes people who have not developed symptoms of the virus.\nINFORMATION ABOUT CORONAVIRUS\nWhat is coronavirus and where did it come from?\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses, some of which cause illness in people, and others of which circulate among animals. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 was a type of coronavirus, as was Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2013. The current virus is referred to as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) because it is a type of coronavirus that had not been previously identified.\nThe 2019-nCoV was first identified in December in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.\nHow is the virus spread?\nSome viruses, such as measles, are highly contagious. Others, less so. At this time, it's unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people. Based on current information, the CDC considers this is a very serious public health threat. However, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time. Here's information from the CDC on the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses. Because this virus is so new, scientists are still learning the basics about it\u2014how it acts and spreads, and how severe it is. Most respiratory illnesses are spread when an infected person has symptoms, such as coughing or sneezing.\nWhat are the symptoms of this virus?\nConfirmed cases of the illnesses have ranged from people being mildly sick to people being severely ill and dying. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC believes at this time that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or up to 14 after exposure.\nIt's important to remember that we are in the midst of cold and flu season. If you have not been in China, it is unlikely that you have been infected with 2019-nCoV. By comparison, influenza can be a serious illness. The CDC estimates that since 2010, each year between 9 million and 45 million have the illness and between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths are attributed to the flu.\nWhat precautions should I take to guard against coronavirus?\nThere is no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The CDC recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of any type of respiratory virus, including washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and staying home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm sick?\nIf you were in China in the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, please seek medical care right away. Dartmouth students should contact Dick's House, at 603-646-9400 and faculty and staff should contact their primary care provider. Before going to a health care appointment, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms. Also, avoid contact with others. Don't travel while sick.\nIf you develop fever or respiratory illness within 14 days of travel to or from China, contact the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services at 603-271-4496.\nWhat precautions is Dartmouth taking to guard against coronavirus?\nConsistent with CDC recommendations, the Dartmouth College Health Service and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center are screening those seeking care for cough and fever and asking about recent travel to affected areas.\nWhat if I am planning to travel to China in the near future?\nThe U.S. Department of State has elevated its China travel advisory to a \"Do Not Travel\" level for all of mainland China. In accordance with this advisory, Dartmouth-sponsored travel to China is prohibited at this time. China is now included on Dartmouth's list of countries for which a travel waiver is required. See the Global Dartmouth website for the most up-to-date information on travel restrictions.\nOn Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus to be a global health emergency. The next day, the United States declared the virus a public health emergency and announced that temporary travel restrictions would be put in place beginning Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. Individuals traveling from China who are able to enter the U.S. will be screened at ports of entry according to CDC and U.S. Customs and Border Protection enhanced health screening protocols.\nIs there anything we can do to accommodate those who may have difficulty traveling to campus from China?\nDartmouth offices should accommodate requests to change in-person interviews to remote interviews if asked by applicants from China seeking Dartmouth positions or entry to schools or programs. The candidates should be reassured that a distance interview will not negatively affect their application. Employees and students who have recently been in China and are instructed to isolate themselves should contact their supervisor, professor, or dean to let them know that they will be affected and to determine the details of an alternate work arrangement.\nHow is Dartmouth supporting community members who may be affected by the coronavirus outbreak?\nWe recognize that students, faculty, staff, and members of their families may be affected by this outbreak. We urge anyone who would like to speak to a counselor on their own behalf or out of concern for someone else to contact our available resources: the Faculty/Employee Assistance Program, the Office of Counseling and Human Development, the College chaplain's office, or the undergraduate dean on call. Assistance is available 24 hours a day, every day. For help, call Safety and Security at 603-646-4000.\nFor more information:\nDartmouth College Health Service\nGlobal Dartmouth\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nNew Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/02/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus"},
{"title": "It's Full Speed Ahead at Dartmouth's Organic Farm", "text": "Nature is not in lockdown. While COVID-19 has brought many indoor Dartmouth activities to a temporary halt, the growing season is at full tilt at the Organic Farm. And even though manager Laura Braasch and her assistant, Molly McBride '14, don't have student interns to help them get this year's crops in the ground, they worked overtime to get seedlings going in the greenhouse.\nMeanwhile Dartmouth's student farmers found creative, nurturing ways to maintain their close agricultural community during this stay-at-home time. Since the students can't yet get their hands dirty on the farm, Braasch and McBride sent a little bit of the farm to each of them.\n\"For Earth Week, Molly and I made these little hand-stamped seed packets of kale and sunflowers seeds that we grew last year and we mailed them out to people who requested them, so they could plant them at home,\" Braasch says.\nIn the silver-lining department, the pause in manual labor has given some students the time to work together remotely on long-term projects that might otherwise simmer on the back burner.\n\"Using Zoom, we're planning a permaculture garden, identifying the plants, coming up with the design, and figuring out where we want to plant stuff,\" says Braasch. \"We're trying to think of it as an opportunity to tackle some of those projects that just take a little bit more research and thought.\"\norganic-farm.jpeg Organic Farm employee Molly McBride '14 waters plants in one of the greenhouses. (Photo by Robert Gill)\nShe and McBride have also been creating short videos to help professors knit organic farming practices into course content. \"For example, Theresa Ong, assistant professor of environmental studies, is working with us for her class in sustainable food systems,\" Braasch says.\nWhether gathering around the pizza oven, sharing harvest dinners, playing music or brewing kombucha, the organic farm crews play as avidly as they work. Even during the COVID-19 crisis, they've held Zoom baking classes and dance parties, and they've filled their Instagram stream with both lighthearted and more serious stories about living, planting, and eating through a pandemic.\nClub leader Rachel Kent '21, who is from Indianapolis, missed seeing spring come to the farm. Even though she was raised in a corn-belt state, she'd never really been interested in agriculture until she came to Dartmouth.\n\"You know, you drive through the Midwest and it's not inviting at all, all those fields of monoculture. But when I came to New England and saw these wonderful farms, including our Organic Farm, that are beautiful and green, and you can walk out into the fields and snag a lunchbox pepper, that's really cool,\" she says.\nA geography major and Stamps scholar, Kent hopes that by the time those peppers are ripening, she'll be back in Hanover, filling her basket. It's not certain yet, when or if in-person classes\u2014and farming\u2014will happen this fall. But she's staying optimistic.\n\"I think it's really, really important for Dartmouth students to take the time out of their normal lives and come together at the farm to celebrate the seasons, celebrate each other, listen to good music and eat good food. And I think all that is at the heart of community, bringing gratitude and joy, and those things are even more important right now, in the midst of this pandemic, than they ever were before.\"\nAll of this year's Organic Farm produce will be donated to Willing Hands, an Upper Valley nonprofit that distributes free, wholesome food to people in need. Braasch says the farm is putting a priority on nutritious crops that can be easily stored, like beets, kale, squash, beans, and carrots (as opposed to highly perishable vegetables, such as tomatoes). And there will be plenty of lettuce, which can be hard to come by at food pantries. The farm is also planning to provide produce to students who have needed to stay on campus and may not be able to meet all their own food needs.\n\"It's always so uplifting to start planting after a long, dark winter, but this year it feels especially hopeful,\" says Braasch. \"The world keeps turning. We're going to get through this, and we're going to start inching back to a reality that we're all familiar with, when we can all interact with each other again. We have such a dedicated community of students who love the farm and who treat this land as their home.\"", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/06/its-full-speed-ahead-dartmouths-organic-farm"},
{"title": "Video: Chimes Sound in Gratitude for Dartmouth Workers", "text": "In normal times, when classes are in session, the Baker bells form a familiar fabric of sound at Dartmouth, their songs and chimes ringing out regularly across campus. But, of course, these are not normal times. A recent addition to the bell schedule aims to show gratitude for Dartmouth workers who are coming to campus each day, medical professionals, and other essential employees who continue to serve the community during the pandemic.\nEvery day at 7 p.m., the bells in Dartmouth Library's Baker-Berry Library bell tower will peal for two minutes. The bells are programmed, from within the tower or remotely, by students in the Masters Program in Digital Musics. By ringing them, Dartmouth joins people and institutions across the world in using sound to acknowledge those among us who are taking the biggest risks.\n\"We so greatly appreciate the Dartmouth staff members who come to campus every day to perform essential duties, as well as the health care professionals on the front lines combating the virus and its effect on the Upper Valley,\" says Sue Mehrer, dean of libraries. \"The ringing of the bells every day at 7 p.m. is our way of saying thank you.\"\nThe details differ\u2014from tolling church bells to songs belted out of open windows to tributes shouted from city stoops\u2014but the feeling behind them is the same.\n\"It is a privilege to be able to help echo the sentiment of gratefulness that we all feel for the folks on the front lines,\" says one of the Dartmouth bell ringers.\nFor the latest information on Dartmouth's response to the pandemic visit the COVID-19 website .\nAimee Minbiole can be reached at aimee.minbiole@dartmouth.edu.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/05/video-chimes-sound-gratitude-dartmouth-workers"},
{"title": "Earth Day, Now 50, Sparked Biology Professor's Career", "text": "Mary Lou Guerinot, a professor of biological sciences, was a high school junior in 1970 when a substitute teacher, social unrest, and the first Earth Day celebration set her on a career path that has traversed several branches of science.\nBut whatever field she's working in, her research reflects a common theme.\n\"I've always picked more ecological problems to work on,\" says Guerinot, the Ronald and Deborah Harris Professor in the Sciences. \"I'm a molecular geneticist. I identify genes and figure out what they do, but I pick problems that I think will have an impact.\"\nGuerinot is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Society of Plant Biologists. In 2018, she received the Stephen Hales Prize from the American Society of Plant Biologists for her work as a world leader and educator in that field. Her discoveries, \"made with her collaborative network, increase our understanding of plant biology, contribute to better farming practice, and offer the possibility of improved human nutrition,\" the society said.\n'It Just Seemed to Make Sense'\nGuerinot's interest in biology was first piqued by a substitute teacher.\nThe graduate student was \"much more exciting and interesting than the nun who'd been teaching us,\" says Guerinot, who attended an all-girls Catholic school in Rochester, N.Y. \"And then Earth Day came along, and with all the antiwar stuff, and everybody protesting, it just seemed to make sense.\"\nThe inaugural Earth Day came at a time when rampant dumping of pollutants had rendered two-thirds of the nation's waterbodies unsafe for fishing or swimming.\nThe connection didn't register with her back then, but in retrospect, she realizes that the effect of contamination of the Genesee River was visible near her home. \"There were always dead fish on the beach.\"\nIntending to become a marine biologist, Guerinot earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University, followed by a PhD in marine biology from Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, where she worked on an issue affecting a vital local industry. Sea urchins were overgrazing the kelp, destroying the kelp beds and depriving lobsters of vital habitat, leading to a decline in the lobster population and fishery.\n\"There were a lot of us working on different parts of the problem,\" she says.\nNext, Guerinot did postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Maryland, researching marine nitrogen fixation, and at Michigan State University, in the Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, where she focused on nitrogen fixation associated with terrestrial plants. At the same time, she turned her attention to learning molecular biology, then an emerging field.\n\"It was an exciting time, and I decided I had an opportunity to switch and I did. It would be harder to do now, but at that time not that much was known,\" she says, laughing.\n'Eat Lower on the Food Chain'\nGuerinot joined the faculty of the Department of Biological Sciences in 1985. She served as department chair from 1994 to 1998, as the associate dean of the faculty for the sciences from 1998 to 2001, and as vice provost from 2001 to 2004. She is a professor in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program and the Microbiology and Molecular Pathogenesis Program.\nHer genetic research work, funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, includes exploring ways to boost plants' nutritional value, use less fertilizer, and remove toxins from the soil. For many years she has focused on iron uptake in plants.\nPlants currently aren't a good source of iron, especially the grains that most people rely on \u2014 maize, rice, and wheat, she says. \"Red meat is a good source of iron, but we're trying to get people to eat lower on the food chain.\"\nShe's also working on figuring out how to get plants to grow in nutrient-poor soil, which would reduce the need for fertilizer and decrease pressure on more fertile land, including the Amazon, Guerinot says.\nHer research also includes determining how to prevent arsenic from ending up in the part of grain that people eat, Guerinot says. The naturally occurring toxin has caused cancer in people living in places with high levels of arsenic in their water, including Bangladesh and parts of South America.\n'Other Ways to Contribute'\nGuerinot and her husband, C. Robertson McClung, the Patricia F. and William B. Hale 1944 Professor in the Arts and Sciences, often discuss climate change in their Emerging Infectious Diseases course, which they co-teach.\n\"We're trying to keep pointing out all the different ways that climate change is going to be affecting things,\" including where mosquitoes live, she says. \"That's where the malaria is.\"\nThe students \"keep me on my toes,\" says Guerinot, who received Dartmouth's Dean of Faculty Award for Outstanding Mentoring and Advising in 2015. \"They are excited about learning; they want to make a difference; and they are enthusiastic about contributing to sustainable solutions to the world's problems. They ask great questions, and together we look for answers to those questions.\"\nAnd as they mull over their career choices, Guerinot uses her experiences to help guide them, sometimes in unexpected ways.\n\"When students want advice, I always tell them, 'Well, my path wasn't that straight. I started over here and then I switched,'\" she says. \"You just don't have to go to graduate school in biology. There are other ways to contribute.\"\n'If Everybody Just Did a Little Bit More'\nGuerinot had hoped Earth Day, celebrated annually on April 22, would draw the world's attention to climate change this year. But due to COVID-19, it won't be the \"glorious 50th anniversary\" organizers were hoping for, she says.\nAs part of its virtual commemoration, Earth Day Network is offering challenges individuals can tackle online and at home to combat climate change, such as switching to renewable energy and registering to vote, and other actions that bolster the organization's ongoing campaigns, according to the network's website. Those include Foodprints for the Future, which urges people to change their eating habits to support environmental and human health.\nThis appeals to Guerinot, who served on a National Academies panel that produced a report on the same issues.\n\"Science Breakthroughs to Advance Food and Agricultural Research by 2030\" addressed a number of topics, including food waste, \"a major issue,\" she says, and animal production. \"So much of the water that's used in agriculture goes to produce animals, and a lot of the grain that's grown is used to feed animals.\"\nFoodprints highlights the environmental cost of growing, transporting, and storing food, and how individuals and institutions can lessen their impact.\n\"I'm pretty excited about Beyond Meat and Impossible Burgers,\" which can be used to replace a portion of the red meat someone might normally eat, says Guerinot. There's hope for change, she says, \"if everybody just did a little bit more, thought about it a little more.\"\nAimee Minbiole can be reached at aimee.minbiole@dartmouth.edu.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/04/earth-day-now-50-sparked-biology-professors-career"},
{"title": "Faculty Reflect on Transition to Online Teaching", "text": "Spring term began full force after a quick but comprehensive ramp-up, thanks to dozens of departmental teams who collaborated with academic departments and programs to move classes online in response to COVID-19. From adjusting schedules, to revamping assignments, formats, and content, faculty members have made myriad changes to adapt their courses to the virtual environment. Dartmouth News recently checked in with three professors about the transition, and strategies they're using to provide the most effective, engaging classes possible during this difficult and troubling time.\nleavitt-v2.jpg William Leavitt, an assistant professor of earth science and an adjunct assistant professor of chemistry and biological sciences, listens to Akshay Mehra, a Neukom Fellow, speak over Zoom to Leavitt's geobiology class. Mehra gave a guest lecture on his \"very awesome paper,\" Leavitt says.\n'Kind of Inspiring'\nWhen the news hit that spring term would be online, William Leavitt turned to Twitter. Leavitt, an assistant professor of earth science and an adjunct assistant professor of chemistry and biological sciences, noted what his friends at institutions such as Harvard and the University of Arizona, which went online within just a few days, were doing to adapt. He felt grateful.\n\"At least I've got two weeks to plan,'\" Leavitt remembers thinking, a timeline that was \"kind of inspiring and also horrifying and daunting.\"\nThe geobiology course he's currently teaching is skill-driven, with a focus on reading and analyzing cutting-edge, primary literature or reviewing papers. Normally it comprises two or three lectures and a few journal discussions each week, but Leavitt adjusted the schedule soon after spring term started.\nWhile he has \"infinite respect\" for his colleagues who are putting in enormous efforts to record their lectures, that wasn't the best approach for him, says Leavitt, who is also co-teaching a graduate seminar this term. \"I play well off of audiences. I knew I was going to come off flat.\"\nInstead, Leavitt turned to his far-flung network of colleagues, who have been happy to share their expertise through live online lectures.\nThe lead-up to those Friday morning talks starts on Monday, when students annotate a journal article penned by the guest lecturer, answering questions in a shared Google doc, where they can read one another's responses. As they work, Leavitt fields questions in real time via Slack or Canvas.\nAlthough it wasn't easy to find a workable time\u2014the 13-person roster includes students on both coasts and one in Turkey\u2014they meet on Thursdays to discuss the article in small breakout groups and annotate the figures together over Zoom, using Hypothesis, an app offered through Canvas.\nLeavitt polled the class about the format and learned they're happy with fewer lectures and more discussion, and they appreciate the scientists who've been Zooming in from as far away as Scotland and Israel, Leavitt says. \"It is fun, I think, for the students. They're like, 'Whoa, this person's real.'\"\nFortunately, except for the odd power outage, the students have been able to participate using their phones and laptops, says Leavitt, who's working mostly from home in Plainfield, N.H. The location \"up a gravel road, up a gravel road\" means his sole choice for internet connection is DSL\u2014slow, but generally stable, as long as he and his wife turn off their other devices.\nBut Fridays, when guests are coming in via Zoom, find him in his campus office, Leavitt says. \"I don't want to have a dropped connection.\"\nzoom_class_4_sunglim_kim.jpg Sunglim Kim, associate professor of art history, remotely teaches \"East Meets West\" from a Dartmouth classroom.\n'The Actual Class Feeling'\nIn the short lead-up to spring term, Sunglim Kim, an associate professor of art history, surveyed her students, asking about their locations and Wi-Fi availability, their goals for the course, and suggestions for remote learning.\n\"East Meets West,\" one of two classes she is teaching this term, is scheduled to meet three mornings a week. But with two-thirds of the 24 students scattered across the United States, and the others in Asia and Europe, Kim was concerned about the time differences.\nInitially, she tried several teaching methods, from narrated PowerPoint presentations, to small group discussions, to lectures on Zoom, either recorded or live. For a time, she gave the same lecture twice on class days, once at the regular time and once at 8 p.m. EST, for students in Asia.\nUltimately, she decided to give live lectures via Zoom at 11:30 a.m. EST, the original class time, accompanied by PowerPoint Open XML Presentations she uploads in advance.\nThe process is time consuming but it works well, says Kim. And surprisingly, the original class time draws the greatest number of students.\nThere are challenges\u2014students sometimes have to contend with uncontrollable background noise and weak internet connections, says Kim. And she prefers classroom teaching, with its face-to-face interactions between herself and the class, and among the students themselves. But she's finding workarounds.\nFor students who are unable to tune in to class, Kim provides one-on-one lessons, Zoom meetings that serve as her office hours. And since the online format can make it difficult for large groups to engage in constructive dialogue, Kim says, she assigns weekly writing assignments and requires students to correspond with one another about their work.\n\"That way they read other classmates' responses and have some interactions with one another,\" says Kim, who encourages students to respond to each other's online posts. \"While not the same as in-class discussion, it still gives students a chance to read about other students' perspectives.\"\nAnd to put herself in the right frame of mind, she teaches from a classroom on campus. \"Even though no student is there,\" she says, \"it gives me the actual class feeling.\"\nbedi-photo.jpg For his remote \"classroom,\" Sonu Bedi chose a banner to convey a message to students. \"We're still all Dartmouth,\" says the associate professor of government and the Hans '80 and Kate Morris Director of the Ethics Institute.\n'We're All Learning, and That's OK'\nAt first, Sonu Bedi was uneasy about taking his classes online. \"I'm very old school,\" he says. \"I use a chalkboard.\"\nTo prepare, Bedi, an associate professor of government, the Joel Parker 1811 Professor in Law and Political Science, and the Hans '80 and Kate Morris Director of the Ethics Institute, looked to resources unique to the remote learning environment, finding pedagogical silver linings, even in the uncertainty.\nSince live online lectures don't allow for the same interaction as a classroom, Bedi has been recording them in advance for his \"Constitutional Law, Development, and Theory\" class. The process has made him think more deliberately about the concepts he's trying to convey.\n\"In class, I could spend my time moseying my way there. I could see what students were not understanding\" and reframe the information, he says. But without that real-time feedback, lectures need to be even clearer.\nThat modification led to others, including a new assignment for students\u2014written responses to those lectures and the accompanying slides. The papers enable Bedi to gauge understanding and plan weekly Zoom classes, which address students' questions and include small group discussions held in online breakout rooms.\nThe adaptations have \"a lot of pedagogical value,\" he says. \"So, that's been quite nice.\"\nAnd, as it happens, current events have given the course, which explores state and federal decision-making powers, even greater relevance.\n\"The pandemic is revealing the federal nature of our system in a way that I haven't seen, at least since I've been teaching this course,\" says Bedi. Many of the issues they discuss in class, such as federalism and the role of the state and the national government, are now frontpage news, enabling him to advance the concepts of the course like never before.\nAnd the students, who are watching the news closely, are more engaged than ever, Bedi says. \"They're quite impressive. They're asking all these questions.\"\nGiven the challenges of the term, he's placed a premium on enjoyment.\nPeople learn best when they're relaxed and comfortable, so being at home can be a benefit, says Bedi, who encourages students to use the situation to their advantage.\n\"Just because it's online doesn't mean we can't have fun with it,\" he told his students. \"You can listen to my lectures as if you're watching a movie or something. Get yourself some Twizzlers.

And that as they are finding their way, so is he.\n\"It gives us an idea that we're all learning, and that's OK, which I think can make us be more comfortable with uncertainty,\" Bedi says.\nAs trying as uncertainty can be, it offers opportunities.\nBeing unsure about how something will go can open up space for learning, Bedi says. \"Dartmouth students take to it.\"\nAimee Minbiole can be reached at aimee.minbiole@dartmouth.edu", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/05/faculty-reflect-transition-online-teaching"},
{"title": "Institutional Diversity and Equity's Evelynn Ellis to Retire", "text": "For the past 12 years\u2014until COVID-19 shuttered campus for the spring term\u2014staff and administrators arriving at Parkhurst Hall early in the morning may have heard the lyrical tones of a clarinet running up and down scales or shaping the notes of a Mozart concerto.\n\"I practice every day early in the morning,\" says Evelynn Ellis, vice president of Institutional Diversity and Equity, who before beginning her career in higher education trained as a classical musician, specializing in late classical and early Romantic chamber music. \"I start every day with practice, and the rest of the day I'm in that musician's place of calm. It's the best gift I could give myself.\"\nEllis retires from Dartmouth July 1, with plans to spend time with family and loved ones (\"whenever we can go visit family again\"), to garden, and yes, to make music. And though the halls of Parkhurst may be quieter in her absence, she leaves a profound legacy on campus.\n\"There are few colleagues who have done more to move Dartmouth's culture forward on critical issues of equity and diversity than Evelynn Ellis,\" says Provost Joseph Helble. \"She has also been a driving force behind Dartmouth's annual Martin Luther King Jr. celebration, a powerful event on campus each year, and one that brings our community together around the ideals of social justice.\"\nEllis came to Dartmouth in 2008 as director of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action and was named vice president of IDE in 2011.\nBefore Dartmouth, she was senior director of the Office of Graduate Educational Equity Programs at Pennsylvania State University, where she had worked in a variety of roles related to equity and outreach since 1985.\nPerhaps most visible on campus in her role as co-chair of the annual celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. each January, Ellis helped oversee the launch and\u2014as a member of the executive committee\u2014the execution of the Inclusive Excellence initiative begun in 2016 as an effort to increase inclusion and diversity at Dartmouth for faculty, staff, and students.\nInclusive Excellence is one of three major initiatives Dartmouth has started in recent years to improve campus climate, along with Moving Dartmouth Forward, an effort to prevent high-risk behavior, and the Campus Climate and Culture Initiative (C3I), which addresses issues of sexual misconduct and other abuses of power in the Dartmouth community.\nOf these initiatives, Ellis says, \"They have created a conversation, and shifted that conversation in the direction that it should go. What I hope now is that the conversation develops into additional concrete action items, because it's a cultural change that's needed.\"\nShe cautions that progress often meets the most resistance when it starts to work. \"The term I use often is 'don't blink,'\" she says. \"Once you start to get momentum, some people will start to push back. But people wouldn't push back if you weren't being successful. So I would ask my institution: Don't blink. When people start to resist good things that you're doing, keep pushing.\"\n\"There aren't many leaders who are so in tune with the needs of their people,\" says Theodosia Cook, who recently left her role as Dartmouth's director of C3I to become chief diversity officer at the University of Colorado.\n\"What people don't know about Evelynn is she manages from the point of view that her people are more than just employees at Dartmouth\u2014they are whole human beings,\" Cook says. \"She has worked through so many challenges at Dartmouth with that perspective\u2014that we must all recognize that faculty and staff aren't just Dartmouth employees, because creating a more inclusive environment means considering the whole human being. I am so grateful for the sacrifices Evelynn has given to our community and I know the next chapter will be beautiful.\"\nRabbi Daveen Litwin, dean and chaplain of the Tucker Center for Spiritual and Ethical Life, calls Ellis \"a deeply valued colleague whose soft voice and powerful spirit impacted the lives of multitudes of students, faculty, and staff through her unwavering dedication to diversity and inclusion.\"\n\"Whether addressing issues of systemic inequity, lifting up stories of social justice, or bringing her own gifts of music through voice and clarinet to the annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. celebrations at Dartmouth, Dr. Ellis has modeled courage, grace, and fortitude.\"\nEllis was born in Sawyerville, Ala., and says she learned to sing before she learned to speak full sentences. She discovered classical music when, as a child, she happened to hear Mahler's Symphony No. 1 on the Birmingham public radio station.\n\"It took my breath away. And I knew: I'm going to play music. I was a poor kid in the South, but that music sealed my fate,\" she says. She studied music as an undergraduate at Alabama Lutheran College and Concordia College in Bronxville, N.Y., and earned a master's in music performance, clarinet, from Penn State.\nBut she was always drawn to equity issues in higher education\u2014\"what my elders would have called 'paying attention to the least of us,'\" she says. That led her to complete her DEd in higher education administration at Penn State.\nIn the current crisis that is the COVID-19 pandemic, structural inequities in higher education and elsewhere are more starkly visible than ever, Ellis says, as some students have ample access to internet, study space, and other resources, while others face precarious circumstances.\nEllis says the pandemic played a role in her decision to retire.\n\"I've never taken life lightly, and this virus has made it crystal clear that we can't take it for granted. It's been eye-opening for me. Life is short, and it goes so quickly. All of my life, my priority has been my career, and it's time for me to shift.\"\nHannah Silverstein can be reached at hannah.silverstein@dartmouth.edu.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/04/institutional-diversity-and-equitys-evelynn-ellis-retire"},
{"title": "Centers Explore New Ways to Build Public Engagement", "text": "Centers and institutes across Dartmouth are exploring ways to continue their public events and maintain community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the coming weeks, Dartmouth News will write about some of the creative solutions that have emerged. Next week: public programming in the Dartmouth arts community.\nThe Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy has launched Rocky Watch, a weekly series of live broadcasts that the center hopes will foster a virtual common space for community discussion in this time of social distancing and remote learning.\nLeading off the Zoom-based program is Russell Muirhead, the Robert Clements Professor of Democracy and Politics and interim director of the Rockefeller Center. Muirhead will speak on \"Conspiracy Without the Theory: How conspiratorial thinking is undermining democracy\u2014and what can be done about it,\" followed by a public discussion. The event begins tonight, April 8, at 5. There is a link to the Rocky Watch series on the Rockefeller Center webpage.\nCenters and institutes have been scrambling for ways to maintain and build the kind of public engagement, debate, and discussion that is the life blood of the liberal arts education. Some, like the Rockefeller Center, have set up a beta version, others are very close, and still others are allowing this new public space to grow organically.\nFor example, the Hopkins Center for the Arts has launched Hop@Home, the Hood Museum of Art is producing a series of art appreciation webinars, and the Student Wellness Center has a wide range of online wellness programming. Some, such as the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Collis Center for Student Involvement, are developing programming and reaching out to the community for ideas and input. There are new initiatives coming online every day.\nMuirhead says it is inspiring to see students, faculty, and staff across the institution coming together on the fly to brainstorm new ways to engage and sustain the intellectual and cultural life of Dartmouth under the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nobody has a roadmap, so the point is to try something to get the ball rolling, he says.\n\"Rocky Watch is an experiment. We'll see how it goes\u2014whether there's any audience for it. People are adapting to this new reality, so we're just trying to adapt and see if this works. If it does, we'll do more of it. If it doesn't, we'll try something else,\" Muirhead says. \"It was really an initiative of the Rocky staff to see if they can make something happen.\"\nFor the first episode of Rocky Watch, Muirhead will draw on his latest book, A Lot of People Are Saying: The New Conspiracism and the Assault on Democracy, co-written with Nancy Rosenblum, a professor of government at Harvard. Muirhead plans to talk about the current rise of conspiracy narratives that are completely detached from any fact-based reality, and he will discuss how this phenomenon has hindered the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"I think what we're looking at right now is a government that's having a heck of a time responding to facts\u2014they're very slow in responding to the reality of pandemic, and one of the reasons for that is this ingrained mindset of conspiracy,\" Muirhead says.\nAfter more than a week of working out the technology and logistics of remote learning, Muirhead says he is seeing a strong appetite among students and faculty to get back to substantive discussions of ideas. People seem to be craving face-to-face contact as opposed to viewing prerecorded content during this time of social isolation, he says.\n\"A lot of students are opting for synchronous contact. I've heard from professors who are having their students vote in their classroom about what they want to do, that students are saying 'we want to be in the class together at the same time,' \" Muirhead says. \"So maybe there will be even more demand for a live event like Rocky Watch where you can be present with other people, even if it is mediated by technology.\"\nVisit the Dartmouth events calendar on the Dartmouth homepage for scheduled public programming. In addition, many centers and programs are building up their online presence in the wake of the pandemic, such as the Leslie Center for the Humanities, the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship, and Wellness at Dartmouth,.

{"title": "When Not in Rome: A Rome LSA on Remote Learning", "text": "Read the full story by Tania Convertini and the Winter 20 Rome Language Study Abroad-Plus Students, published by the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning.\nAfter their time in Italy was cut short due to the COVID-19 health crisis, Winter 2020 Rome LSA+ director Tania Convertini, language program director in the Department of French and Italian, and students had to quickly restructure their term for remote learning. Here they share lessons learned and suggestions for faculty and students transitioning to remote learning this spring.\nOn Feb. 24, my Rome LSA+ students and I gathered at my house for dinner after their week of break and exploration across Italy. Over dinner, before resuming classes the day after, we spoke about the places they visited, what they learned, and how they had applied the intercultural learning abilities developed during our trip to Milan. At that time, we were already reading news about the coronavirus. We were becoming increasingly aware of our behaviors, but we were not worried yet about what we now know would become a pandemic problem. We were ready to resume our program together spending the last three weeks of it on the completion of an interdisciplinary field research project. The program's culminating experience would have given students the opportunity to apply all the skills developed in the three courses taken in Rome. We all shared a sense of excitement and anticipation for what was still ahead of us.\nOnly two days later, I had to announce to the group that they should return to the United States as soon as possible and that the program would continue remotely. Of course, nobody was happy about it, but we did what we had learned to do in the previous weeks. We put our minds together and thought of meaningful solutions to the problem.\nFor the latest information on Dartmouth's response to the pandemic visit the COVID-19 website.", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/04/when-not-rome-rome-lsa-remote-learning"},
{"title": "Philosophy Professor on Finding Comfort in Uncomfortable Times", "text": "Professor of Philosophy Samuel Levey lives on a remote hill in Lyme, N.H. His internet is unstable, and he loses power when the wind blows. That was when life was normal.\nLike so many others, Levey suddenly feels distant. Even when surrounded by family, the sensation can strike. \"It can seem as if no matter where I am, I am alone,\" he says about the disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. It's a feeling that is echoing through Dartmouth's dislodged community.\nBut Levey realizes that these feelings are perfectly normal. \"Our emotional connections naturally expect physical proximity,\" he says, \"it's hard to feel complete when we are not close to each other.\"\nLevey, chair of the philosophy department, is a scholar in metaphysics. Though written years ago, his faculty page asks questions that seem tailor-made for the times: \"What is truth?\" \"What is the past apart from memory?\" \"How can something remain one and the same through change?\"\nThese are questions that are almost certainly going through the minds of students, faculty, and staff who find themselves reexamining their lives.\nLevey admits that philosophy is better at posing \"reevaluated questions\" than offering concrete answers, but he is convinced that it can provide comfort and guidance for anyone whose rituals have been ravaged by a near-invisible pathogen that is causing so much visible pain.\n\"Life is an experience filled up with what we are doing, but also with what seems possible to do at any one moment,\" says Levey. \"Right now, with so many plans washed away, how we are used to feeling and how we actually feel are oceans apart.\"\nPhilosophy by itself won't solve problems, Levey acknowledges, but he believes it can help people see the guiderails that frame society: Philosophy sees the big picture; philosophy provides clarity of thought; and philosophy can help make the not-so-normal somehow make sense.\nAs Aristotle said, humans are \"by nature social animals.\" Reflecting on the instances of isolation brought on by COVID-19, Levey agrees. \"Our emotional response to the pandemic shows that social connection may be what matters most to people. We yearn for the emotional satisfaction that comes with proximity.\"\nHe says that while \"social distancing\" is the label of the times, it's the physical distancing that makes learning, working, and playing alone so difficult. \"Many people still have the amenities of modern life\u2014including social tools like video calls, chat, and text\u2014but not being close to one another makes things radically different.\"\nThe latest in communications technology will be at Levey's disposal when he co-teaches \"Humanity by Design\" with Associate Professor of Film and Media Studies Mark Williams in the spring term. The two have taught the class before, but they are in \"rapid startup mode\" to prepare for the unknowns of remote teaching.\n\"Faculty are working with fervor to reconfigure entire classes,\" Levey says. \"We want to get this right. There are so many decisions to be made about classes, but we no longer have the luxury of walking down the hallway and knocking on someone's door.\"\nOnce classes start, he'll hold office hours throughout the week to accommodate students in different time zones. As department chair, he'll also hold office hours for department faculty. \"There is a tremendous amount of concern going into making certain of the well-being of students and faculty as we work within the realities of distance learning and teaching,\" he says.\nSo, how can something remain one and the same through change?\nEven as the College is temporarily emptied of everyday rituals, Levey believes that the Dartmouth community will remain strong and whole. \"Students and faculty may be scattered for a time, but we can still create a college\u2014and as the name implies, study together.\"", "url": "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2020/03/philosophy-professor-finding-comfort-uncomfortable-times"}
